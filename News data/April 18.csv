AAPL","(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. scaled back its outlook for a chip market expansion, cautioning that the smartphone and personal-computing markets remain weak.Most Read from BloombergElon Wants His Money BackDubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits CityRecord Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud SeedingSingapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to QatarRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor CostsThe world’s largest maker of advanced chips cut its expectations for 2024 semiconductor market growth — excluding memory chips — to about 10%, from above that figure. Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei also trimmed his growth forecast for the foundry sector, which TSMC leads. Meanwhile, the company maintained its estimates for spending at anywhere between $28 billion and $32 billion amid capacity expansion and upgrades this year.“Macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, potentially weighing on consumer sentiment and end-market demand,” Wei told analysts on a conference call. TSMC’s stock slid more than 6% in Taipei, the biggest intraday decline in about 18 months.The outlook overshadowed what was otherwise a solid beat on projected revenue that reaffirmed the growth TSMC and other chipmakers are seeing from demand for all things artificial intelligence. The new forecast also highlights the diverging fortunes of those who make chips for consumer products and those who are designing and manufacturing the most advanced chips for AI processing.TSMC’s forecasts may prove to be a sign of what’s to come as other chip giants prepare to post earnings. ASML Holding NV — the sole provider of the world’s most advanced chipmaking machines — reported a 22% miss on first-quarter bookings on Wednesday. Other companies including Intel Corp. report next week.Inside TSMC Chairman Liu’s Short But Impactful Reign: Tim CulpanFor a liveblog on TSMC’s earnings, click here.TSMC’s forecast follows the company’s first quarterly profit rise in a year. The main chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. expects revenue of $19.6 billion to $20.4 billion in the June quarter, beating estimates for about $19.1 billion.Story continuesThat outlook may help assuage some investors worried that AI demand won’t hold up, or that a smartphone recovery may be longer in coming. TSMC only last week disclosed its fastest sales growth since 2022, suggesting demand for the chips that accelerate artificial intelligence development is beginning to offset the fallout from a smartphone market slump. Apple, which accounted for about a quarter of TSMC’s revenue in 2023, started the year with a deep decline in iPhone sales.TSMC continues to expect revenue to grow by at least 20% this year as the broader semiconductor market recovers, despite global macroeconomic volatility.The Taiwanese chipmaker said it will begin mass production of next-generation 2nm chips in the last quarter of 2025, narrowing its timeframe from next year in general. And Wei added that TSMC’s automotive business will fall this year, versus previous projections for a rise, without elaborating.TSMC has gained about $340 billion of market value since an October 2022 trough, riding bets it will become one of the clearest winners of a global boom in AI development. On Thursday, it recorded a better-than-projected 9% rise in net income to NT$225.5 billion ($7 billion) for the March quarter.Executives said the earthquake that rocked Taiwan this month damaged some wafers used in its chip production, depressing gross margins by about 50 basis points or 0.5 percentage point in the June quarter.Read More: TSMC Says Quake Damaged Some Wafers, Leading to Small Profit HitLonger term, investors expect AI-focused chips to gradually take up a larger proportion of revenue. TSMC’s AI revenue is growing at a rate of 50% annually, the company said in January.Still, some investors have warned that the current level of AI chip demand is unsustainable over the long run. Others remain wary given the uncertainty hanging over the Taiwan Strait — the narrow body of water between China and an island it views as part of its territory.“The demand is very high, extremely high, and we’ll do our best to increase our capacity to alleviate the shortage,” Wei said of AI demand. “Probably not enough this year, but for next year we’ll try very hard.”--With assistance from Gao Yuan, Mayumi Negishi, Ville Heiskanen and Cindy Wang.(Adds share action in the third paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite DemandThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Oil prices rose suddenly early Friday with Brent and West Texas Intermediate climbing more than 2%.Contracts for the S&P 500 fell more than 1% Friday, placing the US benchmark on track for a sixth consecutive decline should the underlying index end Friday lower.The moves echoed a downbeat mood across markets that weakened Asian equities. Japanese stocks fell around 2%, while those in Australia and South Korea dropped more than 1%. Chinese benchmarks were mixed in opening trade.Haven assets rallied. Treasury yields fell, with the 10-year’s nearing 4.5%. An index of dollar strength also advanced despite the dip in yields, as investors sought shelter.The yen was slightly firmer against the greenback. Japanese inflation data released Friday came in below economists’ estimates. The 2.7% monthly reading for March was just short of the 2.8% consensus forecast.

His Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic said he doesn’t think it will be appropriate to ease until toward the end of 2024. The Fed may “potentially” hold rates steady all year, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari told Fox News Channel.In economic data, US jobless claims remained subdued, consistent with a healthy job market. Separately, the Philadelphia Fed factory index topped estimates. While existing-home sales fell, the pace was roughly in line with the median forecast of economists.The market’s biggest worry right now is inflation, which is re-accelerating and throwing cold water on the idea of any rate cuts in 2024, according to Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management.“We are firmly in the camp of no rate cuts in 2024,” he said. “We believe investors should prepare for a higher-for-longer regime when it comes to both inflation and interest rates and that investment portfolios should be positioned for these dynamics for the foreseeable future.”Most emerging market currencies fell on Thursday, with the Mexican peso among the laggards as rising volatility derails carry trade positions that has propelled the currency higher for the past few months.

The outlook remains negative.“The recent increase in confrontation with Iran heightens already elevated geopolitical risks for Israel,” the company’s statement said.S&P said a wider regional conflict was not its baseline scenario, but could have a further material negative impact on Israel’s security situation. That would then impact its economic, fiscal, and balance-of-payments parameters.All three major rating firms have put out warnings on Israel’s credit score since the onset of the war with Hamas. On Oct. 25, S&P revised the outlook to negative on risks the conflict spreads into the country. Moody’s Ratings gave the nation its first-ever sovereign rating downgrade in February, assigning the nation the sixth-highest investment-grade score.Tensions in the region have intensified since Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles on Israel in response to a strike in Syria that killed several Iranian officers on April 1.

Stocks have slumped after taking in a hot inflation report for March, escalating tensions in the Middle East, and hawkish guidance on Fed rate cuts, causing the S&P 500 to notch four straight days of losses.But opportunistic investors shouldn't rush into stocks just yet, Lee said, pointing to a surge in the VIX, the market's volatility gauge. Higher volatility typically triggers selling among investors, he warned, which could lead to near-term pressure for stocks.""While we normally like to buy dips, as we said earlier this week, the surge in the VIX says we gotta take buying the dip extra slowly,"" Lee said in a video sent to clients on Thursday.A buying opportunity could come soon, as the market looks poised to bottom, Lee said. That's largely because the positive catalysts for stocks are still in play, like strong corporate earnings growth. The S&P 500 is on track to report earnings growth of over 7% for the first quarter, per estimates from FactSet.The Fed also looks poised to cut interest rates sometime this year, even if rate cuts could be delayed further than investors are expecting. Markets are now pricing in one or two rate cuts by December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.Lee predicted markets could hit a trough within the next month or possibly sooner, assuming that Middle East conflict does not escalate further, volatility eases, and investors show signs that they're slowing their pace of selling.Story continues""This pullback, I think, is very good because it's providing good entry points,"" Lee said. ""All the things that are supporting stocks are still in place.""Lee predicted the S&P 500 could hit 5,200 by the end of the year, but has noted the index could notch 5,500 or higher in the best-case scenario. He was spot-on in his 2023 stock forecast, correctly calling a 20% gain in the benchmark index.Read the original article on Business Insider"

Edwin Drake, an American businessman, drilled the first successful oil well, at Titusville, Pa.At the time, some people called the project “Drake's Folly,” but it actually marked the birth of the modern petroleum industry.Related: Get ready for $5-a-gallon gasolineDrake sold his ""black gold"" for $20 a barrel and people have been buying the stuff ever since.Diamondback Energy  (FANG)  has been making its mark in the Permian Basin, which is located in the Southwest and has the distinction of being the highest producing oil field in the country.On Feb. 12 Diamondback said it would buy a privately held rival, Endeavor Energy Partners, in a $26 billion cash-and-stock deal that would “create a premier Permian independent operator.”“This is a combination of two strong, established companies merging to create a ‘must own’ North American independent oil company,” Travis Stice, Diamondback’s chairman and CEO, said in a statement. ""With this combination, Diamondback not only gets bigger, it gets better.”During a Feb. 21 call with analysts, Stice said that in his experience, ""as companies get bigger, the more inwardly focused they become.""So, they focus more on their own results and less on what others are doing around them,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Chevron said it was buying Hess  (HES)  for $53 billion.Diamondback Energy is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 30 after the market closes.Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the company to report profit of $4.38 a share on $2.09 billion of revenue. A year earlier Diamondback earned $4.10 a share on $1.92 billion in revenue.In February, the company posted a fourth-quarter profit of $4.74 a share on $2.23 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street's call for $4.70 and $2.16 billion.Analyst focuses on acquisitionAnalysts recently have been reacting to Diamondback's plans.Last week, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar raised his price target on Diamondback to $217 from $200 and affirmed a buy rating on the stock.The price-target hike came amid expectations that Diamondback could finalize its acquisition of Endeavor Energy Resources sooner than initially anticipated.Kumar noted that Diamondback Energy has risen about 35% this year. (The stock closed on April 17 at $201.15.)More Economic Analysis:Watch out for 8% mortgage ratesHot inflation report batters stocks; here's what happens nextInflation report will disappoint markets (and the Fed)An April 8 regulatory filing by Diamondback outlined a possible timeline for the completion of the Endeavor transaction, he said. A shareholder vote is scheduled for April 26, Kumar said. According to Mizuho's analysis, the deal might close in the second quarter, but its base case is closing sometime this year.ScotiaBank analyst Paul Cheng also raised his price target on Diamondback shares last week, boosting it to $255 from $210 while reiterating a buy rating on the stock.The update came after the firm published a commodity price deck, where it raised its near- and long-term oil-price forecasts.On April 17, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read raised the firm's price target on Diamondback Energy to $227 from $203 and held to an overweight rating on the shares.Based on robust operational momentum, the firm sees potential upside to 2024 U.S. onshore oil production estimates, translating to another year of higher-than-expected U.S. supply growth.Continued drilling and completion efficiency improvements, incremental cost deflation, and a focus on high grading should combine to create positive momentum throughout 2024, Read added.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024"

Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $6.5 billion in assets, produced annualized returns of 10% for the past 12 months, negative 30% for the past three years and negative 1% for five years.That’s quite woeful compared with the S&P 500. It posted positive returns of 23% for one year, 8% for three years, and 13% for five years.Ark Innovation’s numbers also fall well shy of Wood's goal for annual returns of at least 15% over five-year periods.<img alt=""Famed investor Cathie Wood, Mama Cathie to her followers.<p>PATRICK T.

FALLON/AFP via Getty ImagesCathie Wood’s simple investment philosophyHer investment strategy is pretty simple. Ark ETFs usually purchase emerging-company stocks in the high-tech categories of artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. Wood maintains that companies in those categories will change the world.Of course, these stocks are quite volatile, so the Ark funds frequently fluctuate up and down. Wood adds to and subtracts from her top names frequently.Related: Morningstar unveils top-tier semiconductor stocks to ownInvestment research titan Morningstar offers a harsh assessment of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF. Investing in young companies with slim earnings “demands forecasting talent, which ARK Investment Management lacks,” Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold wrote in March.The potential of Wood’s five high-tech platforms listed above is “compelling,” he said. “But the firm’s ability to spot winners and manage their myriad risks is less so…. It has not proved it is worth the risks it takes.”This isn’t your father’s investment portfolio. “Wood’s reliance on her instincts to construct the portfolio is a liability,” Greengold said. “The highly correlated stock prices of its holdings belie its apparent diversification across many sectors.”Story continuesWood has defended herself from Morningstar’s criticism. “I do know there are companies like that one [Morningstar] that do not understand what we're doing,” she told Magnifi Media by Tifin in 2022.“We do not fit into their style boxes. And I think style boxes will become a thing of the past, as technology blurs the lines between and among sectors.”But some of Wood’s customers apparently agree with Morningstar. During Ark Innovation’s rally of the past 12 months, it suffered a net investment outflow of $2 billion, according to ETF research firm VettaFi.Cathie Wood keeps buying Tesla, selling DraftKingsOn April 16-17 Ark funds bought 87,187 shares of electric vehicle titan Tesla  (TSLA) , valued at $13.6 million as of April 17’s close.Tesla shares have dropped 39% this year to $150 on April 18. So Wood likely viewed this as a buying opportunity. She has regularly snapped up the electric-vehicle company’s stock during periods of weakness, expressing admiration for Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and his clean-energy goals.Related: Maserati's latest drop-top EV is cooler than anything made by Elon MuskWood reiterated her $2,000 valuation for Tesla shares in early April. She initiated that goal a year earlier. So it’s no surprise that Tesla is the biggest holding in Ark Innovation.Despite Wood’s enthusiasm, Tesla’s performance is faltering. Sales are sluggish, with deliveries sliding slid 8.5% in the first quarter.Cheaper Chinese vehicles have eaten into Tesla’s market share in that key country. Last month Tesla’s sales volume there fell to the lowest level in more than a year.This week, Musk announced a 10% reduction in the company’s workforce, and two senior executives resigned. He said he’s looking for “cost reductions and increasing productivity.”Fund manager buys and sells:Cathie Wood buys $22 million of battered tech stockFund manager of $100 million long/short mutual fund explains pair trade strategyGoldman Sachs revamps conviction list after stocks soar in Q1Meanwhile, Ark funds sold 285,524 shares of online sports gambling platform DraftKings  (DKNG)  April 16.

Recent rallies in gold and copper prices have done little to lift the S&P/ASX 200 Materials Index, down 6.6% for the year, due largely to share declines in behemoths BHP Group Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd, which account for over half the gauge. In contrast, the Bloomberg World Mining Index is up almost 7%.

Miner shares have trailed falling iron ore prices, which have sunk by 17% this year as China’s real estate slump continues to damp steel demand. Both Rio Tinto and BHP get more than half of their revenue from China.

Still, there might be some positives for miners: ore prices are rebounding after dipping below $100 a ton, and quarterly production updates from BHP and Rio Tinto cast copper as a bright spot for both miners. SBG Securities analyst Tim Clark raised the recommendation on BHP to buy from hold following its trading update.

“We do expect the demand outlook out of China to stabilize into mid-year and be supportive of early-stage commodities, such as iron ore, coal,” UBS analysts including Lachlan Shaw wrote in an April 9 note.

Prolonged US dollar strength may also benefit Aussie miners’ profits as their US dollar-denominated export incomes gain from favorable exchange rates.

Nearly half of all two-year Treasury futures positions are held by fewer than eight traders. For longer maturities like five and ten years, just eight hedge funds control about 30% of the market.In August last year, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman made headlines by initiating a short position on U.S. 30-year Treasuries, anticipating soaring U.S. budget deficits.  This move netted him over $200 million when he closed the position in October.Story continuesSo far in 2024, U.S. Treasury bonds have underperformed. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) has dropped almost 9% since the beginning of the year, and the Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury ETF (NYSE:EDV) has seen a decline exceeding 12%.US Debt-To-GDP Ratio Set To Rise To 134% By 2029It remains uncertain whether the hedge funds’ substantial short positions are in part a bet against U.S. fiscal health, anticipating that yields will remain elevated due to ongoing loose fiscal policies.The IMF’s ‘Fiscal Monitor’ suggests that increasing public debt, primarily in China and the United States, coupled with tightening monetary policies, are contributing to higher long-term government bond yields and their volatility in the U.S.In 2023, the U.S. general government fiscal deficit expanded dramatically to 8.8% of GDP, up from 4.1% the previous year, driven by a sharp decline in income tax revenues and increased spending. The deficit is expected to slightly decrease to 6.6% of GDP in 2024 but will rise again in 2025.The IMF projects that the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio will continuously climb from 122% in 2023 to nearly 134% by 2029.""Public gross financing needs will remain at levels higher than those before the pandemic over the medium term based on high existing debt burdens and persistent fiscal deficits. China and the United States have large gross financing needs of more than 25 percent of GDP in the near term,” the IMF wrote.The IMF’s forecasts suggest that the U.S. Treasury will need to issue a substantial amount of bonds to refinance maturing debt and cover the spiraling deficit, a reality that hedge funds are keenly exploiting.YearGovernment Deficit (As % of GDP)Government Debt As % of GDP2023-8.8122.12024-6.5123.32025-7.1126.62026-6.6128.92027-6.2130.72028-6.4132.62029-6133.9Data: IMF Fiscal Monitor – April 2024Read now: Treasury Yields Head To ‘Danger Zone’: Analyst Forecasts Potential Spike To 5%, Disorderly Sell-Off For MarketsPhoto: Shutterstock""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article Small Group Of Hedge Funds Wields Dominance In US Treasury Market: 'A Concentration Of Vulnerability Has Built Up,' IMF Warns originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-souring-teslas-pivot-142450120.html,Wall Street is souring on Tesla's pivot away from low-cost vehicles towards autonomous driving,"Thu, April 18, 2024, 5:24 PM CDT",,"Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BITesla is losing the confidence of Wall Street amid reports it's pivoting from a low-cost Model 2 to robotaxis.Deutsche Bank just downgraded Tesla's stock and Barclays cut its price target. Both see double-digit declines over the next year.""We view Tesla's shift as thesis-changing, and worry the stock will need to undergo a potentially painful transition in ownership base,"" Deutsche Bank said.Another day, another negative Tesla note from Wall Street.Tesla has come under intense scrutiny from sell-side analysts after a Reuters report from earlier this month said that the EV maker was shifting away from its low-cost Model 2 vehicle to instead focus on building a fully-autonomous robotaxi.Deutsche Bank downgrades TeslaDeutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner is not impressed with the potential pivot, calling it ""thesis-changing"" for investors in a note on Thursday.Rosner downgraded Tesla stock to ""Hold"" from ""Buy"" and cut its price target to $123 from $189, suggesting potential downside of about 19% from current levels.""Pushing out Model 2 will create significant earnings and FCF pressure on 2026+ estimates, and make the future of the company tied to Tesla cracking the code on full driverless autonomy, which represents a significant technological, regulatory and operational challenge,"" Rosner said.Rosner slashed his 2027 earnings per share estimate for Tesla to $2.40 from a prior estimate of $4.25, and added that there could be further downside to the company's earnings power if they completely abandon the development of a low-cost vehicle.""The delay of Model 2 efforts creates the risk of no new vehicle in Tesla's consumer lineup for the foreseeable future, which would put continued downward pressure on its volume and pricing for many more years, requiring downward earnings estimate revisions for 2026+,"" Rosner said.Tesla stock fell 2% in early Thursday trading, and is down nearly 40% year-to-date.Story continuesPerhaps the biggest risk to Tesla, aside from lower earnings, is the idea that a pivot to robotaxis could cause a complete recalibration of its underlying shareholder base.""We view Tesla's shift as thesis-changing, and worry the stock will need to undergo a potentially painful transition in ownership base, with investors previously focused on Tesla's EV volume and cost advantage potentially throwing in the towel, and eventually replaced by AI/tech investors with considerably longer time horizons,"" Rosen said.Barclays cuts Tesla price targetIt's not just Deutsche Bank that has soured on Tesla.Barclays slashed its Tesla price target on Wednesday by 20%, and said it expects the company's first-quarter earnings call next week to be a negative catalyst.Calling it ""one of the most widely anticipated calls ever,"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said the company is facing challenging near-term fundamentals in combination with a longer-term ""investment thesis pivot"" as it considers moving away from the Model 2.According to Levy, if Tesla is indeed moving away from the Model 2, that would be bad news for the stock valuation going forward, calling it a ""clear net negative for the Tesla investment thesis.""""It casts significant uncertainty on the path ahead for Tesla, making success of the stock dependent on bets with seemingly binary outcomes,"" Levy said. ""Indeed, we are hard pressed to think of any other precedent of a company of Tesla's size basing its path of success on such binary bets.""Wedbush also concerned about Model 2 pivotEven long-time Tesla bull Dan Ives is worried about Tesla's potential pivot away from a low-cost Model 2.In a note from last week, Ives said Tesla needs to commit to its Model 2 development plans if it wants to have any chance in reversing this year's painful stock price decline.""If robotaxis is viewed as the 'magic model' to replace Model 2 we would view this as a debacle negative for the Tesla story. It would be a risky gamble if Tesla moved away from the Model 2 and went straight to robotaxis,"" Ives said.Ives said Wall Street's criticism of Tesla is warranted, especially given the fact that the EV maker has seen declining profit margins and its first year-over-year sales decline since 2020.""For Musk, this is a fork in the road time to get Tesla through this turbulent period otherwise dark days could be ahead,"" Ives said.Read the original article on Business Insider"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-vs-etfs-invest-213953905.html,Stocks vs. ETFs: Which should you invest in?,"Thu, April 18, 2024, 4:58 PM CDT",,"If you’re getting started investing, you might wonder whether it’s better to invest in stocks or ETFs. Well, the answer depends. Stocks can be a great investment in some circumstances, while ETFs can be better in others. But for new investors, exchange-traded funds solve many problems, and they’re an easy way to earn attractive returns — so they’re a great starting point.Here’s all you need to know about stocks vs. ETFs and when it’s best to use each one.Stocks and ETFs: How they differStocks and ETFs are similar in some ways, not surprisingly, since ETFs often contain many stocks. Despite their likenesses, they’re fundamentally different and present various upsides and risks.StocksA stock represents a fractional ownership interest in a business and typically trades on an exchange, in the case of a publicly traded company. When you own a stock, you’re investing in the success of that company — and only that company.In the short term, stocks may rise and fall for many reasons, and market sentiment often determines how a stock performs day to day. In the long term, however, a stock more closely follows the company’s growth. As the company expands its profits, the stock will tend to rise as well.Individual stocks can perform phenomenally over time, but they may be volatile in the short term, fluctuating massively. It’s not unusual for high-flying stocks to decline 50 percent in a given year on their way to long-term outperformance. On the other hand, a strong stock might go up 50 percent or more in a single year, especially if the overall market is hot.ETFsETFs are collections of assets, often stocks, bonds or a mix of the two. A single ETF might own dozens, sometimes hundreds, of stocks. So by owning a single share of the ETF, investors can own an indirect stake in all the stocks (or other assets) held by the fund. It’s a great (and often inexpensive) way to buy a collection of stocks.ETFs often invest in stocks that have a specific focus area, for example, large companies, value-priced stocks, dividend-paying companies or those operating in a specific industry, such as financial companies. Some specialized ETFs allow you to potentially earn higher returns.Story continuesMost ETFs are passively managed, meaning that they replicate a specific index of assets, such as the S&P 500, a collection of hundreds of America’s largest companies. The ETF changes its holdings only when the underlying index changes its constituents.Because of their wide array of holdings, ETFs provide the benefits of diversification, including lower risk and less volatility, which often makes a fund safer to own than an individual stock.An ETF’s return depends on what it’s invested in. An ETF’s return is the weighted average of all its holdings. So if it owns many strong stocks, the ETF will rise. If it owns many poorly performing stocks, then the ETF will decline, too.The table below shows some of the key differences between stocks and ETFs.CharacteristicStocksETFsPotential upsideHighLow-high, depending on the investmentRiskHighLow-high, depending on the investmentLifetimePotentially infinitePotentially infiniteBrokerage commissionsNo commission at major online brokersNo commission at major online brokersWhen you can trade themAny time the market is openAny time the market is openTaxCan be taxed at short-term or long-term capital gains rates, depending on holding periodCan be taxed at short-term or long-term capital gains rates, depending on holding periodThe pros and cons of stocksInvesting in a stock can offer a lot of benefits, though it’s not without some serious drawbacks.Advantages of investing in stocksInvesting in an individual stock can deliver very high returns, and you won’t be taxed on any capital gains until you sell, in a taxable account.A single stock can potentially return a lot more than an ETF, where you receive the weighted average performance of the holdings.Stocks can pay dividends, and over time those dividends can rise, as the top companies increase their payouts.Companies can be acquired at a substantial premium to the current stock price.Commissions on stock trading have been slashed to zero at major online brokers, meaning it doesn’t cost anything to get in and out of an investment.Investors who hold a stock for more than a year may enjoy lower capital gains tax rates.You can still own the wealth-building power of stocks within an ETF or mutual fund.Disadvantages of investing in stocksStocks can fluctuate a lot from day to day and month to month, meaning you may need to sell at a loss and may never recover what you invested.Volatility can be dangerous for investors who have all their wealth tied up in just one or a few stocks. If that one stock does poorly, the investor has a lot of eggs in one basket and can lose a significant portion of wealth.Stocks aren’t an investment guaranteed by the government, so you may lose all your money.Because an individual stock tracks the performance of the company over time, you have to own a winning company to make money. Pick a loser and you’ll lose money.Much effort is required to analyze and value individual stocks, and many people simply don’t have the time or desire to do so.You’ll need to pay taxes on any capital gains you generate, though you also have the ability to write off losses and get a tax break.The pros and cons of ETFsETFs offer plenty of benefits to investors, whether they’re new to the game or are more advanced, though these funds don’t come without some drawbacks.Advantages of investing in ETFsETFs allow you to buy one fund and have a stake in dozens or even thousands of companies.Because of this broad ownership, ETFs offer the power of diversification, reducing your risk and increasing your returns.A well-diversified ETF such as one based on the S&P 500 can beat most investors over time, making it easy for regular investors to do well in the market.ETFs tend to be less volatile than individual stocks, meaning your investment won’t swing in value as much.The best ETFs have low expense ratios, the fund’s cost as a percentage of your investment. The best may charge only a few dollars annually for every $10,000 invested.ETFs can be bought and sold any time the market is open, giving you a highly liquid asset.ETFs can be traded at no cost at most major online brokers.It takes little investing expertise to invest in ETFs and earn high returns.You won’t be taxed on any capital gains until you sell the ETF in a taxable account.Like stocks, ETFs can pay dividends.Disadvantages of investing in ETFsETFs, even in a good year, will underperform the best stocks in the fund, meaning investors could have owned just those stocks and done better.ETFs do charge an incremental cost, the expense ratio, for owning the fund.Not all ETFs are the same, so investors do have to understand what they own and what it could return.Like stocks, the investment performance of ETFs isn’t guaranteed by the government and you could lose money on the investment.You can’t control what’s invested in any single fund, though of course you don’t have to buy shares in that fund either.ETF vs. stock: Which is better for your portfolio?Buying individual stocks or ETFs can work better for individual investors in a variety of scenarios, and here’s when each one shines:When stocks are betterYou enjoy analyzing and following individual companies. It takes a lot of work to follow a stock, understand the industry, analyze financial statements and keep up with earnings. Many people don’t want to spend this time.You want to find outperformers. If you can find the stocks that will outperform — for example, Amazon or Microsoft — you can beat the market and most ETFs.You’re an advanced investor with time to devote to investing. Many investors enjoy following companies and tracking them over time. If that’s you, then buying individual stocks may be a great option for you.When ETFs are betterYou don’t want to spend much time investing. If you’re looking for an easy solution to investing, ETFs can be an excellent choice. ETFs typically offer a diversified allocation to whatever you’re investing in (stocks, bonds or both).You want to beat most investors, even the pros, with little effort. Buy an ETF based on the S&P 500 and you’ll wind up beating the vast majority of investors over time. That’s right, passive investing with ETFs generally beats active investing.You don’t want to analyze individual companies. If you have no desire to follow business, then pick an ETF or a few, and add to them over time.You’re a new or intermediate investor. ETFs are great for investors who are getting started, helping reduce your risk as your knowledge gets up to speed. But even many advanced investors use them, too.You want to invest in a specific trend without picking winners. Is there a hot new industry but you’re unable to pick which company will come out on top? Buy an ETF and get exposure to the whole sector at low cost.Of course, it’s possible for investors to do both of these strategies. For example, you could have 90 percent of your portfolio in ETFs and the remainder in a few stocks that you enjoy following. You can hone your skills at investing in individual stocks without hurting your returns much. Then, when you’re ready you can shift to more individual stocks and away from ETFs.Bottom lineETFs make a great pick for many investors who are starting out as well as for those who simply don’t want to do all the legwork required to own individual stocks. Though it’s possible to find the big winners among individual stocks, you have strong odds of doing well consistently with ETFs. Of course, you can blend the two methods as well, getting the benefits of a diversified portfolio with the potential extra juice from a few individual stocks on the side, if you want to try your skill.Note: Bankrate’s Rachel Christian also contributed to this story.Editorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-freight-long-trucking-market-215841265.html,State of Freight: How long will trucking market trough linger?,"Thu, April 18, 2024, 4:58 PM CDT",,"The bottom of the weak freight market may be here, according to Craig Fuller speaking at the April State of Freight webinar. (Photo: FreightWaves)With the equities market for trucking stocks reeling this week on the backs of two companies’ highly bearish disclosures, one question loomed large on the FreightWaves State of Freight webinar: Are we getting near the bottom?Battered and bruised in #trucking this a.m. due to numbers from $JBHT and $KNX. At approximately 10:50, here were some of the % drops: $XPO, -4.6%; $WERN, -2.5%; $TFII, -7%; $SNDR, -4.3%; $SAIA, -3.4%; $ODFL, -5.5%; Hunt, -9.2%; Knight Swift, -4%; $FWRD, -9.08%; $ARCB, -8%. pic.twitter.com/NeCAhaDZVG— John Kingston (@JohnHKingston) April 17, 2024FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller and the head of market research for FreightWaves’ SONAR data dashboard, Zach Strickland, were mostly optimistic that the answer might be yes. Here are five takeaways.J.B. Hunt’s earnings may be the sign that things are at a bottomFuller called a recent negative earnings report by J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ: JBHT) and a lowering of forecast earnings by Knight-Swift (NYSE: KNX) a “capitulation” that could signal a market bottom.Story continuesReferring to an article he wrote for FreightWaves earlier this week, Fuller said the article did not herald a recovery in freight markets. Rather, “it’s a market bottom.”“I just think the market is capitulating,” Fuller said. “There’s an interesting thing in financial markets where you almost need everyone to sort of agree to give in for there to be a market recovery. To me, this is a moment of capitulation.”Fuller said previously in the down cycle, larger carriers had signaled in earnings calls, presentations and simple market anecdotes that the bigger companies were “unwilling to sort of make significant concessions in terms of rates.”But now, “we’re seeing the larger carriers capitulate.” And that leads to bullishness on his part because it brings about more of a normalization between spot and contract prices. “I think as we see contract rates refresh as new rates come in, I am bullish for that, as that is the capitulation,” Fuller added.On the J.B. Hunt earnings call, Darren Field, the president of intermodal at the company, said the market has been “a dogfight, with truckload capacity pricing being really, really competitive.”Capitulation, Fuller said, involves “the moments where the larger carriers have realized that they’re going to have to do things that they did not want to do.”The demand side of the equationVolumes are “relatively strong,” Fuller said. He and Strickland, who moderates the webinar, pointed to the Contract Load Accepted Volume index in SONAR. It is up 9% in the past year.Strickland said CLAV is especially useful at showing freight volumes because the data is stripped of tender rejections. “So it’s a pretty good measure of the absolute volume carried by some of the larger fleets,” he said.The fact that it’s up 9% in a year “tells me that volume is pretty robust,” Fuller said. The problem continues to be “just too much capacity.”Fuller added that projections of U.S. GDP growth — noting 3% growth in the first quarter — generally signal higher freight volumes down the road. “It’s conceivable that if we get a 2% to 3% GDP growth that we could be back to sort of where we were a year ago,” Fuller said. But he added, “I’m not suggesting there’s going to be a massive surge.”Strickland added, “One of the things that I have trouble kind of conveying to people right now is that it’s not a demand issue.”An anniversary nobody wants to acknowledgeFuller said he dates the start of the Great Freight Recession to the end of March 2022. The first recession that accompanied the start of the COVID pandemic brought the Outbound Tender Volume Index in SONAR down to less than 9,000, and as Fuller said, there was a belief that it might drop to 7,000. The OTVI currently stands near 11,325.The upside of the V-shaped recovery that quickly followed the beginning of the pandemic brought the OTVI back up to pre-pandemic levels by June 2020. That strong cycle lasted until about March 2022 before it entered the down period that is now in the midst of its second anniversary.It shows up in many places, but Fuller said it most clearly is in the Outbound Tender Reject Index, which measures contract freight that carriers choose not to lift. It dropped from about 15% two years ago to its long-languishing stay in the 3% to 5% range, where it has been pretty much for those 24 months.A Trump election could impact buying patterns“The threat of Donald Trump winning the election is going to force retailers and importers to think differently about what they do in the supply chain,” Fuller said when asked about how November’s presidential election might impact freight markets. Trump’s promise for even more robust tariffs than in his first administration will need to be on the mind of importers should a Trump return to office become evident as Election Day draws closer. “I think he’s going to move relatively quickly to start putting these tariffs in place because he’ll feel like he wants to send a really strong message,” Fuller said.Given that, it’s likely that companies may begin to build inventories ahead of new tariffs. Fuller also noted that given some recent steps by the Biden administration, and its failure to take the Trump-era tariffs off, “they’re both protectionist.”“The bottom line is, I do think we will see increased imports as we did back in 2017,” Fuller said, referring to the period before the first tariffs were implemented by the Trump administration.Measuring private fleetsFuller said OTRI and OTVI do not measure private fleet activity because there is no such thing as tendered freight to be rejected. The private fleet handles whatever comes its way. “We do know that the private fleets expanded aggressively during COVID and have continued to do that,” he added.The continued growth in sales of Class 8 tractors even in the midst of a freight recession is likely the result of increased private fleet activity, according to Fuller. “We’re not sure exactly how much but it definitely affected us for sure,” he said.More articles by John KingstonScopelitis seminar delves into lease purchase deals, M&A, ESG and more5 auto haulers combining to create publicly traded trucking companyCTA, OOIDA to appeal court decision upholding AB5 in California truckingThe post State of Freight: How long will trucking market trough linger? appeared first on FreightWaves."

Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud SeedingSingapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to QatarRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs“A concentration of vulnerability has built up, as a handful of highly leveraged funds account for most of the short positions in Treasury futures,” the IMF said in its Global Financial Stability Report released this week. “Some of these funds may have become systemically important to the Treasury and repo markets, and stresses they face could affect the broader financial system.”The IMF’s comments came in a section discussing the so-called basis trade, which contributed to turmoil in the world’s biggest bond market at the time of the pandemic outbreak in 2020.In this trade, hedge funds exploit tiny differences between the prices of cash Treasuries and futures, using large sums of money borrowed from the repurchase-agreement market to amplify returns. Because of this leverage and reliance on short-term funding, the bet has drawn increasing scrutiny from regulators. And now the IMF is highlighting another risk: concentrated positions.Read more: The Kings of a Colossal Bond Trade That’s Spooking RegulatorsAs of December, about half the two-year Treasury short positions in the futures market were in the hands of eight traders or less, according to the IMF. It was at a similar level at the end of 2019, just before a surge in funding costs in the early days of the pandemic spurred traders to unwind the positions, which helped boost volatility in bonds at a time of upheaval across financial markets.The IMF didn’t cite specific funds, but Bloomberg reported in December that firms including ExodusPoint Capital Management, Millennium Management and Citadel have used the wager.Story continuesThe IMF acknowledged that basis trades are helpful in providing market liquidity under “normal” conditions. But it also expressed concern that the trade’s rapid growth lifted the leverage in the financial system.The popularity of basis trades swelled along with the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes, which potentially make the strategy more profitable by widening the price gap between the cash and futures markets.Read more: What’s the Basis Trade? Why Does It Worry Regulators?: QuickTakeA Fed study last month estimated that hedge funds have amassed at least $317 billion in Treasury holdings related to basis trades since the first quarter of 2022, although the size is “significantly” less than it previously estimated.The Securities and Exchange Commission has been working to rein in basis trades and increase the transparency of hedge funds’ exposure to the strategy. In December, the SEC required the funds and brokerages to centrally clear far more of their US Treasuries transactions, a move to bolster oversight of basis trades.Since then, there are signs that use of the trade may be waning: Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows a decline in leveraged funds’ short positions in bond futures.The concentration in these bets has also diminished. In two-year futures, net short positions controlled by eight traders or less have dropped to about 38% of total open interest, from 50% in early January, according to CFTC data compiled by Bloomberg.Despite that unwinding, the IMF noted the short positions of leveraged funds remain large, which means they may still loom as a risk.As the Fed shrinks its holdings of Treasuries, a process known as quantitative tightening, it also may reduce the liquidity in the financial system, potentially triggering a jump in funding costs and leading the basis trade to unravel, the IMF said.“Basis trade investors rely on low repo haircuts and low repo rates to leverage their positions and increase basis trade profitability,” the report said. “A spike in repo rates — triggered, for example, by surprises in quantitative tightening — can render the trade unprofitable and could trigger the forced selling of Treasury securities and a brisk unwinding of futures positions as funds seek to quickly delever.”--With assistance from Liz Capo McCormick and Edward Bolingbroke.(Adds IMF comment in seventh paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite DemandThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

^GSPC","(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest bond market extended this month’s selloff after solid economic readings and hawkish Fedspeak reinforced speculation that interest rates will remain higher for longer.Most Read from BloombergElon Wants His Money BackDubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits CityRecord Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud SeedingSingapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to QatarRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor CostsTreasuries fell across the US curve — with two-year yields once again near the 5% mark. The S&P 500 dropped for a fifth straight session — its longest losing run since October. The dollar rose. An initial quarter-point Federal Reserve rate cut remained priced in for November.When asked about the possibility of hiking, Fed Bank of New York President John Williams said that while it is “not” his baseline expectation, it’s possible — if warranted. His Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic noted he doesn’t think it will be appropriate to ease until toward the end of 2024. The Fed could “potentially” hold rates steady all year, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari told Fox News Channel.Market-implied expectations for Fed rate cuts waned further this week after Chair Jerome Powell signaled policymakers will wait longer than previously anticipated to ease policy. Traders now see just one to two rate cuts this year. That’s a far cry from the roughly six they expected at the start of 2024, and the three that Fed officials penciled in just a month ago.“The Fed rhetoric was skewed hawkishly,” said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. “The data lineup and updates from an array of talking Feds left the market with the impression that Powell’s assessment on Tuesday is the party line — therefore ‘wait and see’ to ‘wait and see’.”Treasury 10-year yields rose five basis points to 4.63%. The S&P 500 fell to around 5,010, with its most influential group — technology — leading declines. Netflix Inc. posted its best start to the year since 2020, attracting more new customers than anyone expected thanks to a strong slate of original programs and a crackdown on password sharing.Story continuesRead: TIPS Auction Stops Through at Decade’s Second-Highest Yield“Fedspeak is making us increasingly nervous,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. He added that if the two-year US yield breaks 5%, the next level to watch would be 5.2%.In economic data, jobless claims remained subdued, consistent with a healthy job market. Separately, the Philadelphia Fed factory index topped estimates. While existing-home sales fell, the pace was roughly in line with the median forecast of economists.“Most of the data this week show the economy is still firing on all cylinders,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That’s going to be a challenge for the Fed’s rate-cutting plans.”Read: Less Dovish Fed Comes Into Line With MarketThe Fed may not cut interest rates at all this year with inflation remaining high, said JPMorgan Chase & Co. President Daniel Pinto.“It may take a bit longer until they can cut rates,” Pinto said at a Semafor event in Washington, adding that the likelihood of a rate hike is “very, very low” amid widespread skepticism that inflation will ease any time soon. The Fed isn’t in any hurry, as a rate cut that comes too early would be “painful” and probably cause a recession, he said.The market’s biggest worry right now is inflation, which is re-accelerating and throwing cold water on the idea of any rate cuts in 2024, let alone one or two, according to Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management.“We are firmly in the camp of no rate cuts in 2024,” he said. “We believe investors should prepare for a higher for longer regime when it comes to both inflation and interest rates and that investment portfolios should be positioned for these dynamics for the foreseeable future.”“With rate cuts delayed, rather than canceled, in our view, we still expect the yield on the 10-year US Treasury to end the year around 3.85%, said Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Once the Fed begins cutting rates this year, the bond market will likely continue to price a sequence of further cuts into 2025 and beyond.”While timing the market is hard, investors can more confidently add duration exposure, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Mark Cabana, who recommend “going long” five-year Treasuries.The trade is supported by “Fed unlikely to hike, risk asset sensitivity to rates and cleaner duration positioning,” they noted.Corporate Highlights:Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai announced changes to Google’s workplace teams structure, saying the moves will help the company develop artificial intelligence products and services faster and more efficiently.Micron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer-memory chips, is poised to get $6.1 billion in grants from the Commerce Department to help pay for domestic factory projects, part of an effort to bring semiconductor production back to American soil.D.R.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/national-average-money-market-account-171030238.html,National average money market account rates for April 2024,"Thu, April 18, 2024, 4:06 PM CDT",,"A money market account is a type of savings deposit account that tends to offer check-writing privileges and a debit card for ATM access to your savings. Typically, savings accounts usually don’t let you write checks from the account, making money market accounts a unique option to store and tap your money when you need it.This article provides the most up-to-date average money market account annual percentage yield, which is 0.46 percent, and insight as to why knowing the average money market account rate is important. It’s easy to earn a much higher return than the average money market account rate by shopping around.The Federal Reserve directly impacts money market account rates at competitive banks. Generally, you’ll find that Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) bank rate increases follow the Fed’s movements. But a Fed rate increase isn’t a guarantee that a bank will raise rates.That’s why you have to compare rates to find the right account for your financial needs.And beyond yields, you’ll want to make sure a money market account has the features that you’re looking for. Check-writing privileges, ATM access, mobile check deposit and a highly-rated app are the features people tend to look for.Except for the potential for check writing, a money market account and a high yield savings account are nearly similar. So it’s also worth considering opening a high interest savings account in your search for a money market account.You might be rewarded for depositing more money in a money market accountSome money market accounts give you a higher APY for carrying a larger balance. These accounts, called jumbo money market accounts, are worth looking into if you’re looking to deposit a large sum into a liquid account. Always make sure you’re following the FDIC’s rules and guidelines to make sure that your money is protected in the event of a bank failure.Latest average money market account APYs for the past 3 monthsDateMoney market account national average APY4/15/20240.46%4/8/20240.47%4/1/20240.47%3/25/20240.48%3/18/20240.48%3/11/20240.48%3/4/20240.47%2/26/20240.47%2/19/20240.46%2/12/20240.47%2/5/20240.47%1/29/20240.47%1/22/20240.46%1/15/20240.48%1/8/20240.46%1/1/20230.47%12/25/20230.47%12/18/20230.46%12/11/20230.46%How we calculate the national average interest ratesIn June 2023, Bankrate updated its methodology that determines the national average CD rates. More than 500 banks and credit unions are surveyed weekly to generate the national averages. Among these institutions are those that are broadly available and offer high yields, as well as some of the nation’s largest banks.Story continuesCompare current money market account rates for April 2024Vio Bank — 5.30% APYUFB Direct — 5.25% APYCFG Community Bank — 5.25% APYQuontic Bank — 5.00% APYSallie Mae Bank — 4.65% APYSee additional best money market account rates.Note: Annual percentage yields (APYs) shown were updated between April 18-25. Bankrate’s editorial team validates this information regularly, typically biweekly. APYs may have changed since they were last updated and may vary by region for some products. Bankrate includes only FDIC banks or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) credit unions in its listings.Bottom lineYou can easily earn more than the national average rate in a money market account. Some FDIC-insured online banks have money market accounts that either don’t require a minimum opening deposit or require a small amount to open the account. These accounts also tend to not have monthly service fees. Low or no minimum opening requirements and no fees are why you should always try and earn many times more than the average rate. But each bank is different, so compare banks to confirm the opening deposit amounts and that the account doesn’t have a monthly fee – or that it has an easy way to waive the fee if it does have one."

The big jump was due to two positive announcements from the company last week.On Friday, April 12, Medical Properties Trust reported the sale of its interests in five Utah hospitals to a joint venture (JV) with an investment fund for around $1.1 billion. Medical Properties Trust owns roughly 25% of the JV. The same day, the healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) declared its quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share -- unchanged from the previous quarter.Why investors liked Medical Properties Trust's news so muchMuch of Medical Properties Trust's value proposition to investors stems from its ultra-high-yield dividend. Some investors were likely worried that the REIT would cut its dividend payout for the second time in nine months. That didn't happen, allowing shareholders to breathe a big sigh of relief.Even better, the sale of the Utah hospitals further fortifies Medical Properties Trust's balance sheet. This deal came on top of another sale announced on April 9 of five facilities in California and New Jersey to Prime Healthcare for a total of $350 million. These transactions improve the likelihood that Medical Properties Trust can continue to pay its dividend at current levels.Is Medical Properties Trust stock a buy now?Medical Properties Trust's latest updates arguably give investors a reason to be cautiously optimistic about the company. The stock could continue to be highly volatile, though. Medical Properties Trust isn't out of the woods just yet. Most investors will be better off avoiding the stock for now. However, the healthcare REIT's dividend yield of nearly 12.2% combined with the potential for a sustained rebound could be tempting to aggressive investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Medical Properties Trust right now?Before you buy stock in Medical Properties Trust, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Medical Properties Trust wasn’t one of them.

The company had added 1.7 million paying users in Q1 2023.Notably, the company said it will stop reporting quarterly membership numbers starting next year.Revenue beat Bloomberg consensus estimates of $9.27 billion to hit $9.37 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14.8% compared to the same period last year, as the streamer leaned on revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported tier, in addition to the recent price hikes on certain subscription plans.Netflix guided to second quarter revenue of $9.49 billion, a miss compared to consensus estimates of $9.51 billion.Netflix's stock has been on a tear in recent months with shares currently trading near the high end of its 52-week range.

Now, with the market scaling back its hopes for interest rate cuts this year, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) is down nearly 3% year to date, underperforming the S&P 500's more than 5% gain this year.""We think the Russell 2000 could be a bit challenged in the near term until we get to kind of greater confirmation of inflation slowing and greater confirmation that, OK, the Fed is going to be able to start cutting rates,"" Bank of America head of US small- and mid-cap strategy Jill Carey Hall told Yahoo Finance.After recent conversations with investors, Hall said the main catalyst for small caps to move higher is more clarity on the Federal Reserve's interest rate path.Market consensus has shifted to projecting two rate cuts this year from seven rate cuts in early January, per Bloomberg data. The move has put a significant damper on the rally in small caps to close 2023, while large-cap stocks have clung to gains this year despite the shifting Fed narrative.The key difference is the companies' debt structures. Small caps have more than 40% of their debt exposed to higher rates either in the form of floating-rate loans or short-term debt that may need to be refinanced amid the higher rate environment. This compares to the roughly 75% of S&P 500 companies, which have long-term fixed-rate debt, per Bank of America's research team.Add in that large-cap companies often have more cash that could benefit from higher rates and that the Fed not cutting rates is simply more costly for smaller companies than larger companies.""The [Russell 2000] index is very sensitive to credit and rates,"" Hall said. ""Refinancing risk is a key risk for these companies given that large caps were able to lock in a lot of long-dated fixed-rate debt ...the longer rates stay high, that becomes a bigger and bigger risk to earnings for these [smaller cap] companies.""<iframe src=""javascript:false"" srс=""https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17617269/embed?auto=1"" onload=""_08a33400_931b_163a_f945_d0048f9aa0f6_u(this, 'https%3A%2F%2Fflo.uri.sh%2Fvisualisation%2F17617269%2Fembed%3Fauto%3D1')""></iframe>Today at 12:24 PM CDT Josh SchaferStocks turn lower in afternoon tradeFor the fourth straight day, the S&P 500 traded in the green to start the day and then reversed lower.The moves came as several Fed officials noted they don't see any ""urgency"" to cut interest rates.

The new rules will prohibit the LME and CME from accepting deliveries of Russian metal produced on or after April 13. The U.S. also banned the import of all three metals from Russia, following the previously leveled 200% tariff on Russian aluminum.The news hit markets slightly before the CME’s closing on April 12, causing prices to spike in the final hours. Prices rose over 1.4% alongside a surge in trading volumes between 4:30 PM and 5:00 PM, as markets began to factor in how the new rules would impact them.<img alt=""Copper prices, April 2024"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/odH2olcqVG2H3q_QuBDc4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTMzMw--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/oilprice.com/d9a1d4f7bb83cacf09bde65fd79d3c5d"" class=""caas-img"">Copper prices, April 2024Both CME and LME copper prices remain within roughly two-month rallies. These saw prices find a bottom in early February before repeatedly breaking above previous highs over the ensuing months. The latest round of sanctions came with upside risk as markets priced in the overall impact. However, prices showed only a slight day-over-day fluctuation by Monday, which saw CME prices rise a mere 0.22% while LME prices slid 0.30%.<img alt=""percentage of Russian-origin metal within LME warehouses, April 2024"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9dHlg2YZVqw6RzxTutAMew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQxNQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/oilprice.com/96a874cbfba3096c65cd87820c0a332d"" class=""caas-img"">percentage of Russian-origin metal within LME warehouses, April 2024The aluminum market saw the most significant increase from Friday’s close, as prices rose 2.08% day over day. Meanwhile, the LME’s aluminum contract came with the greatest risks due to the proportion of Russian metal sitting in LME warehouses. In March, Russian-origin metal accounted for 62%, 91%, and 36% of LME copper, aluminum, and nickel stocks, respectively.Will Exchange Pricing Diverge?As markets deplete the reserves of Russian-origin metal within inventories, it could leave an upside risk to prices, specifically for the LME. The many sanctions announced prior to the most recent ban left a steep discount on Russian metal prices, especially aluminum. This could lead to pricing distortion between the exchanges, although the delta between the two price points currently remains within range of its historical average.Story continuesThat said, the following weeks could threaten the longstanding 99.82% correlation between CME and LME copper prices. Indeed, a wider-than-average delta emerged between LME and CME aluminum prices on Monday. However, this would need to be far more sustained to suggest a meaningful divergence in price trends.Aside from pricing, the ban could see a shift in open interest between the exchanges. Risks for the LME contract could also lead to an exodus toward the CME, which is already widely used in the U.S. as a contracting benchmark for copper prices.As with sanctions past, the new ban will not necessarily cut off the supply of Russian metals from global markets. The rising number of buyers who stopped purchasing Russian metal since the war in Ukraine really only served to push the material to other destinations. China became “the buyer of last resort,” with a steep pickup in imports from Russia compared to historical trade flows.These new bans will likely trigger further rerouting. SHFE inventories could see a boost as they continue to admit Russian metal no longer accepted by Western exchanges. As a result, the rising volume of discounted Russian metal could impact SHFE prices.Differing Contangos Between LME, CME Copper PricesAs with all shocks, the market will require time to price in and adjust to the latest shift. This could translate into increased price volatility across exchanges as markets learn the full ramifications of how the sanctions will impact global price discovery and trade flows. The potential divergence of exchange prices remains the largest risk to markets and buyers, although it has yet to become meaningfully apparent.But while future prices continued to correlate with a negligible delta, primary cash prices began to see a greater divergence between the LME and CME. Though both exchanges show contango, with future prices trending above spot, the spread appeared significantly wider on the LME.Prior to the recently issued sanctions, the copper price rally came with growing risks to its longevity. Supply fears triggered by smelter cuts in China prompted an increase in bullish bets, particularly among investment funds whose large positions hold outsized impact over price direction. This offered strong momentum, which helped prices break out after they found a bottom in mid-February.<img alt="""" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bET._WHBDyCaH.apH16E9w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTM5Mw--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/oilprice.com/0b3cc675abbb698d08d88026b12b5a4f"" class=""caas-img"">However, the market speculation regarding supply fears lacked underpinning from observable tightness within the market on the LME. Therefore, primary cash prices continued to sag beneath their three-month counterparts, expanding the delta between the two to a staggering $116/mt by April 15. This far outpaces the $11/mt average seen since 2012.By comparison, the same spread on the CME totaled only $40/mt. The differing contangos were not caused or triggered by the latest sanctions, but they do suggest the existence of differences between the two exchanges. This could prove increasingly important should the sanctions cause the CME to gain greater influence over the market.By Nichole BastinMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Arab Nations Act Against Iran-Israel EscalationGeothermal Energy: A Win-Win for Democrats and Republicans?Putin Looks To Capitalize As West Diverts Attention From UkraineRead this article on OilPrice.com"

Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud SeedingSingapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to QatarRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor CostsTrump Media & Technology Group Corp. issued instructions on how “long-term shareholders who believe in the company’s future” can prevent brokerages from lending their shares to investors who bet against the stock by selling it short.The parent of Truth Social, in an online FAQ about short selling, put out a form letter investors can use to opt out of any securities lending programs.A spokesperson for Trump Media suggested the guidance was in response to investor inquiries, writing in an email, “TMTG believes it has a responsibility to provide factual information in response to the questions its shareholders are asking.”Short selling doesn’t necessarily cause share-price declines, but it can weigh on the price if there are enough contrarian traders betting against a stock.Skepticism about Trump Media’s business prospects is widespread, as the firm reported just $4 million in revenue last year and a loss of more than $50 million. That and a valuation north of $9 billion sparked a wave of bets against the stock.Some 16% of Trump Media’s public float is sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. Fees for new shorts sellers are between 135% and 215% of the stock’s price — one of the highest on Wall Street.Short sellers have long had a dark image in the popular mind, a view that painted Wall Street actors as out for profit at the expense of American companies and their employees. This portrayal played a prominent role in the meme-stock craze of 2021, particularly around GameStop Corp. There, followers of Reddit Inc.’s Wall Street Bets board powered a rally in the video-game retailer with the express intent of forcing losses onto prominent short sellers.Story continuesGabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital Management was famously bludgeoned in the episode and the hedge fund later shut down.The Trump Media FAQ Wednesday appeared to lean into that negative imagining of short sellers, suggesting the practice was a tussle between the “retail investor” and “sophisticated and institutional investors.”“If the price of the stock in fact decreases, then the brokerage firm and the sophisticated and institutional investors will have made a profit, while the ultimate retail investor has not,” the filing said.Julian Klymochko of Accelerate Financial Technologies called the situation unusual and said Trump Media trading bore the hallmarks of less experienced daytraders.“The shares are held, and traded rapidly, by unsophisticated retail speculators who are looking for fast gambling action in the latest meme stock craze,” he said. “As opposed to fundamental analysts, DJT speculators are more akin to conspiracy theorists, blaming every share price decline on non-existent short sellers.”While it’s true that short sellers will profit if the target stock falls, the lender profits no matter what happens to the short bet, simply by collecting interest. Brokerages, such as Fidelity and Schwab, have programs where clients can opt in to earn income by loaning securities.Trump Media also suggested other ways retail investors could prevent having their shares borrowed, including moving shares into a cash account from a margin account, moving them to Odyssey Transfer and Trust Company — the company’s transfer agent — or moving shares to a bank and holding them in a retirement account.“It’s understandable why a heavily shorted company would like to defeat those who are betting against it,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “But over time, the best way for a company to do that is to deliver on the bottom line.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite DemandThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud SeedingSingapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to QatarRed Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor CostsInternational Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the dollar’s strength has prompted concerns among a number of economies, with all eyes on the US and when the Federal Reserve will be able to lower interest rates. US economic strength was a major factor in the IMF upgrading its global economic growth outlook slightly for 2024, Georgieva said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television.The IMF and World Bank are this week hosting spring meetings of finance and central bank chiefs from around the world. Among the other key subjects are discussions about advancing debt relief for distressed nations and — among Western powers — talks on the scope to step up efforts to aid Ukraine and punish Russia for its invasion of that country.One element of tension emerging from the gatherings has been differences between the US and European Union members over deploying frozen Russian reserves to help Ukraine.(All times Washington, DC, GMT -4)Brazil Sees Global Market Repricing on Fed’s Stance (1:38 p.m.)Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said he anticipates the Federal Reserve’s delay in lowering interest rates will trigger a repricing across global markets.Haddad spoke in a press conference in Washington before heading out Thursday night for an earlier-than-expected return to Brazil. The nation’s congress is now debating a tax-reform package that Haddad has championed.Story continuesAt the same event, Brazilian central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said that the effects from a global repricing in interest-rate expectations are not yet known. But he said that his nation’s external accounts are very strong, helping differentiate its position relative to some others. Markets are very sensitive to US monetary policy, he added.Campos Neto also said Brazil only intervenes in the foreign exchange market to correct malfunctions. -Beatriz Reis and Martha BeckAustralia Still Expects Budget Surplus But Difficulties Rising (1:11 p.m.)A second straight budget surplus in Australia is becoming more difficult but the government is still aiming to announce it later this month, Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in Washington.“The degree of difficulty on that second surplus has come up a little bit,” Chalmers said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “That’s certainly our goal - we’re not quite there yet,” he said, adding that the Australian economy is slowing, the labor market is softening and there is rising global economic uncertainty. -James MaygerBOE Interest-Rate Cutes Are Not Imminent, Policymaker Greene Says (11:40 a.m.)Bank of England policymaker Megan Greene said the UK faces difficult trade-offs over whether to cut interest rates because underlying inflation remains high and growth is weak.Greene said rate cuts were not imminent, though the combination of high inflation and weak growth means “we are sort of in trade-off territory.”“We have to weigh the risk of doing too much against the risk of doing too little,” Greene said Thursday at the event. “Unlike in the US where growth is really strong, it’s not in the UK.”“In my mind, doing too little is the bigger risk because you end up having to hike rates even higher in the end and could end up generating an even bigger recession,” she said. “That would be the worst scenario.” -Philip Aldrick and Tom ReesGoldman President Sounds Alarm on UK ’22-Like Jolt to US MarketsGoldman Sachs Group Inc. President John Waldron warned that out-of-control spending could expose the US to serious risk in the event of a political crisis.“The thing that I worry about is the confluence of a political crisis and a lot of leverage in the Treasury system,” Waldron said at an event organized by Semafor. “The more leverage we have, the riskier we make it. So I wish Washington would get its spending under control.”Waldron drew comparisons with the turmoil that rocked the UK in 2022. Pension funds had used a strategy known as liability-driven investment, or LDI, for protection from falling government bond yields. That move backfired when the government of Prime Minister Liz Truss announced unfunded tax cuts — sending yields soaring, and exposing a major risk at the heart of the UK financial system.“Think about the LDI situation that happened in the UK — that was really precipitated by a political crisis,” Waldron said. A version of that turmoil could emerge in the US if there’s a political crisis, Waldron said. “So I think we should worry about that,” he added. -Todd GillespieGermany Warns Using Russian Assets Threatens Financial Stability (10:11 a.m.)Germany’s Finance Minister Christian Lindner warned that using frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine could jeopardize international financial stability and sovereign immunity.“If third parties have the impression that their sovereign assets are not safe under certain circumstances, international financial stability could be jeopardized,” Lindner said. “We would lose more than we would gain in the long run.”A second concern is the violation of the principle of sovereign immunity, which must be maintained under all circumstances, Lindner said.Lindner referred to a proposal from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Group of Seven talks to leverage the Russian assets, which were frozen after Russia’s attack on Ukraine, by setting up a fund and financing it with the proceeds. About $280 billion in Russian assets have been frozen, with more than two thirds blocked in the EU.“We have no details of such a proposal at the moment, so we are not in a position to assess it in detail in terms of risk profile or volume,” said the German finance minister. However, Lindner added, Germany is open to examining further proposals. -Kamil Kowalcze and Alexander WeberGeorgieva Still Optimistic Fed to Be Able to Cut Rates in 2024 (9:20 a.m.)“The Fed is doing the right thing” by standing pat with its monetary stance for now, Georgieva said in an interview Thursday with Bloomberg Television. “The Fed is not yet prepared, and rightly so, to cut.”A key question at the meetings in Washington has been “how long will the Fed be stuck with higher interest rates,” she said. “That’s what I hear from countries.”“All eyes are on the US,” she said. With regard to the strength in the dollar, she said that “of course it is concerning.” So far, “the business environment in the United States has not reacted very firmly to the interest rates being high — but we see a little softening underneath.” The economy is “slightly overheated” in part because of the US fiscal stance, she said.Georgieva said that “we still remain optimistic that, within this year, conditions in the United States would allow the Fed to start cutting.” -Jonathan Ferro and Christopher CondonECB’s Knot Plays Down Oil Price Risk to European Inflation (9:02 a.m.A jump in energy prices would pose a less acute danger to inflation in Europe than the gyrations in commodities markets seen in recent years, according to European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot.Describing current risks to consumer prices as “becoming more balanced,” the Dutch official told Bloomberg Television’s Lisa Abramowicz and Annmarie Hordern that inflation is subsiding toward 2% across the 20-nation euro area.“Now, if we have an oil shock, it will be against a backdrop of general disinflation in all other factors,” he said Thursday in Washington. “The likelihood of significant second-round effects, I would argue, is smaller but it is clearly something to monitor.” -Mark Schroers and Alexander WeberIMF’S Georgieva Urges Fiscal Tightening to Prep for Next Shock (8:41 a.m.)Georgieva called on major economies to tighten their fiscal policies after a mass ramp-up of debt in recent years to cope with the pandemic crisis.“Countries must urgently build fiscal resilience for the next shock” in a world where crises keep on coming, Georgieva said in a press conference Thursday in Washington. It’s important to be “rebuilding fiscal buffers.”Central banks fighting inflation also “can use some help from the fiscal side,” she said. -Eric Martin and Philip AldrickMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite DemandThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Judges will soon rule if that's legal.,"Thu, April 18, 2024, 1:39 PM CDT",,"Jefferies inserted a $4 million break-up fee in an offer contract and wants it to be paid.Epic Cure/ShutterstockJefferies included a $4 million break-up fee in an offer letter to a banker.The Wall Street bank is demanding payment after Dean Decker stayed with Credit Suisse after signing.A California appeals court is expected to rule shortly on whether the break-up clause was legal.A Wall Street bank inserted a $4 million break-up fee into an offer letter and demanded the payment after the employee backed out. Seven years on, a California appeals court is set to rule on whether the fee was legal.In 2017, Jefferies included the clause to deter Dean Decker, a hotshot banker working for Credit Suisse at the time, from using its $10 million offer as leverage to secure higher pay and a promotion from his employer. Bloomberg reported, citing court filings, that he did exactly that.Break-up clauses are commonly used in corporate mergers to discourage either party from getting cold feet or saying yes to a rival suitor. They also compensate the jilted party for the time and money spent crafting the deal.Jefferies applied the same thinking to its contracts with Decker and others. But Decker's defense team has argued it's a different story to demand $4 million from an individual who's never received a paycheck from your firm, and borders on ransom.""His compensation increased substantially, and he received a promotion solely because he signed the agreement with Jefferies,"" the investment bank and capital-markets firm said in a court filing.""In fact, the only winner was Decker — both Jefferies and Credit Suisse were gamed (pun intended.)""Decker told an arbitration panel that he fully intended to join Jefferies, but changed his mind after another colleague backed out of a deal to join Jefferies, Bloomberg said.If the California judges rule against Decker, that could make companies feel more comfortable imposing penalties on prospective employees.It would also highlight the financial dangers to individuals of parlaying an offer from another employer into a bigger paycheck from their current firm.Story continuesIt's worth noting that Credit Suisse agreed to cover Decker's legal costs and any damages, meaning UBS is on the hook following a merger of the two Swiss banks last year.In the meantime, Decker has moved to Banco Santander, a Spanish banking group.Jefferies and UBS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Read the original article on Business Insider"

However, resilient economic data from the U.S. has dampened these expectations, turning the tide against market optimists.Koutny revealed, “We still think that there's a residual long position left over.” The lack of orderly adjustment in these positions could precipitate a chaotic market selloff, risking a yield spike to critical levels.Despite the prevailing negative market sentiment, the current high yields have attracted some opportunistic buying.Story continuesThe latest data from JPMorgan Chase & Co. indicates a significant shift in investor positioning towards Treasuries, marking the first net long stance since March.

The social media giant seemed to benefit from expected legislation against TikTok and launched the newest version of its Llama large language model (LLM), updating its Meta AI assistant as well.As of 1:24 p.m. ET, the stock was up 2% on the news after climbing as much as 3.7% earlier in the session.<img alt=""A person using a smartphone"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/R7_50_gwL827f0NnRcIx2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTM3NQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/b0a894c1531224a8dd02dfe4e05aa7da"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.Meta gains an advantageFor several months now, social media stocks like Meta have moved on news about a possible ban or forced divestiture of TikTok, the popular China-based social media app, but that legislation now looks like more of a reality than ever before.House Speaker Mike Johnson is reportedly planning to include legislation in a bill to give aid to Ukraine and Israel that would ban TikTok or force owner ByteDance to sell its U.S. ownership.Separately, Meta also introduced several new artificial intelligence (AI) products, showing it will remain a contender in generative AI. The company released Llama 3, its latest LLM, and an image generator that updates images in real time. Those tools will be included in Meta AI, its free AI assistant available in Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.Can Meta keep gaining?The TikTok development is complicated and the issue could spend years in the courts even if a ban is passed, but Meta could certainly see some benefit from legislation as TikTok is arguably its closest competitor now. Meta has invested heavily in Reels, its TikTok competitor, to increase engagement on platforms like Facebook and Instagram.Additionally, any improvement to its AI capabilities is likely to elicit cheers from investors. Though Meta doesn't have a direct way to monetize its generative AI efforts, if they encourage users to spend more time on the platform, then that should increase ad revenue and improve its competitive position. Expect Meta to continue to invest in AI as the new technology is only just starting.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Watchlist","Ibotta began its path as a public company on Thursday by opening at $117 per share, a big increase from its IPO price of $88, itself an increase from its proposed range of $76 to $84 per share.

And this pop is despite boosting the size of its offering earlier in the week, with existing shareholders expanding their sale by just under 1 million shares.

Shares are not continuing to climb in early trading, but are holding steady above its IPO price, at around $100 at the time of writing.

The company left money on the table “for investors who are very bullish on it [expanding] its third-party platform beyond just Walmart,” which has become a key partner for Ibotta and represents much of its current revenue, said Nicholas Smith, a senior research analyst at pre-IPO research company Renaissance Capital. Given that it started trading far above its IPO price today, some critics may argue that it left too much money on the table, and could have raised more for itself.

Its successful debut marks the third major tech IPO in the United States this year, and is the third in a row to price well and immediately trade higher. It is also the first half of a pair of technology offerings that will list this month, with data management and security company Rubrik expected to list its own shares next week. The two companies follow Reddit and Astera Labs out of the private markets, after both the social media company and datacenter connectivity hardware play continue to trade above their IPO prices.

Investor eagerness for Ibotta indicates that “there is an increasing appetite for IPOs again” Smith said, “particularly in the tech space.”

Don’t pop the champagne yet for the tech IPO market coming roaring back, however. Ibotta pivoted to business sales over a direct-to-consumer model, which helped it reach profitability in recent periods. Classic tech IPOs tend to feature tech companies still in growth mode and deeply in the red.

Rubrik could be a better test of IPO appetite. Its products are in the data management and security worlds, and the company is deeply unprofitable and growing more slowly than Ibotta. That said, it does have a strong cloud revenue story to tell. If its debut goes well, we could see more yet-unprofitable unicorns try a shot at the public markets.

Smith agrees, calling the upcoming Rubrik IPO “an even bigger test” for tech debuts “given its weaker current financial picture.”

We’ll find out next week."

Other evidence included a recruiting script for new agents that appeared to deliberately obfuscate their association with Primerica, agent presentations that emphasize recruiting and more.“One text message recruiting script for Primerica agents, obtained by The Bear Cave through online searches, even appears to conceal the role of Primerica and instead instructs recruits to say the company is ‘PFS Inc,’ potentially so friends and family won't find the voluminous online criticism of Primerica,” the short seller said.See Also: Benzinga’s ‘Stock Whisper’ Index: 5 Stocks Investors Secretly Monitor But Don’t Talk About YetBeyond aggressive recruiting, the Bear Cave claimed some top agents also appear concerned about cultural integrity issues at the company, noting that one million dollar earner asked questions about dishonest business practices in a recorded Zoom call from 2023.The Bear Cave also said it obtained complaints against Primerica through a public records request filed with the Florida Attorney General's Office.Story continues“Primerica customers aren't the only ones complaining.
