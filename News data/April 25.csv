            -0.09% ","Shares of Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS), the toy and game maker known for products like Transformers, Magic: The Gathering, and Monopoly, were on the move this week as the stock beat quarterly estimates in spite of a decline in revenue.According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock was up 17.6% for the week as of Thursday's close.<img alt=""Two kids playing on roller skates."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/g6jNbkaXohfJ3rjTxsA1.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/ced99b64ce82c1e653c2f9e5ab61d97f class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.Is this the start of a turnaround?Revenue in the quarter fell 24%, primarily due to the sale of the Entertainment One video entertainment business. Excluding its effect, revenue was down 9% due to a 21% decline in its consumer products business. The challenges in the toy business reflect broader industry challenges and Hasbro's own decision to exit certain business lines and reduce closeout sales.The company finished the quarter with revenue of $757.3 million, though that still beat estimates at $738.6 million.While the decline in revenue might have been disappointing, investors focused their attention on the company's cost cuts, which led to improvements in the bottom line.Adjusted operating profit doubled to $148.6 million. Its adjusted operating margin improved from 4.9% to 19.6% as it slashed inventory by 53%, improved supply chain productivity, and reduced operating costs.On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share jumped from $0.01 to $0.61, which topped the analyst consensus at $0.27.CEO Chris Cocks noted the strong performance of the company's licensing portfolio as it attempts to unlock the value of its intellectual property, a tried-and-true strategy in the children's entertainment industry.Can Hasbro keep climbing?Looking ahead, the company continues to expect revenue to decline. It forecasts a 7% to 12% decline in consumer products, a 3% to 5% decline in the Wizards of the Coast segment, and revenue in the Pro-forma entertainment segment down $15 million.On the bottom line, it forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $925 million to $1 billion, meaning the stock trades at less than 10 times EBITDA. Its 4.3% dividend yield is enticing as well.While the revenue declines are disappointing, Hasbro seems to be on a path toward further gains.Should you invest $1,000 in Hasbro right now?Before you buy stock in Hasbro, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hasbro wasn’t one of them.

            +4.97% ","Ron Baron once told Elon Musk to stop tweeting.Associated Press via Business Wire

Billionaire investor Ron Baron told CNBC that Tesla is ""going to go up huge.""

The stock has reached bottom after investors were unsure if the firm was scrapping plans for a low-cost model.

Baron sees all cars being EVs in 10 to 15 years, and cited Tesla's cost efficiency compared to rivals.

Tesla's stock has reached a positive inflection point and will leave recent lows in the dust now that the company is giving investors what they want, according to billionaire investor Ron Baron.

""Oh, it's going to go up huge,"" he told CNBC on Wednesday. ""Now is the bottom.""

So far this year, Tesla shares have crashed more than 34%, driven downwards by a first-quarter delivery slag, reports of a pivot towards robotaxis, and a string of leadership controversies.

But to the Baron Capital founder, eroding sentiment had less to do with how the electric vehicle maker performed, but whether CEO Elon Musk was still committed to coming through on promised projects.

""When I think about the reasons the stock is down, it's because people were concerned that he was going to abandon the idea of having a low-cost car and go all into robotaxis,"" Baron said.

Doubts first crept in after a Reuters article announced that Tesla was scrapping such plans, a report Musk then went on to deny.

But now, the company's recent earnings call made clear that it would accelerate production of a more affordable model, and would also unveil its robotaxi later this year. Baron expects the firm to make 5 million of the new low-cost vehicle.

He also cited that Tesla could make a profit by eventually selling its full-self driving technology to other carmakers.

While Tesla's earnings also showed a 9% slump in first-quarter revenue, its stock has jumped close to 18% since then.

Before Tuesday's results were published, some analysts have cited long-term burdens that will continue weighing on the company, including an EV recession and rising competition, whether domestically or in offshore markets.

But Baron doubled down that Tesla continues to have a lead, pointing out the firm's cost efficiency. In his view, all cars will also be electric in 10 to 15 years, and hybrids — popular among rivals — won't last.

Meanwhile, China's rising BYD competitor is the only profitable firm in the country, he said, and still does not make as much as Tesla.

Tesla is the biggest holding in the Baron Partners Fund, CNBC said. Previously, Baron disclosed that he has made nearly 20 times its Tesla investment since buying the stock a decade prior.

On Jan 2, the company's stock went for $470 per share.Humana CEO Bruce Broussard acknowledged to analysts during the company’s earnings call “that the industry is experiencing a dynamic and challenging time we must navigate.”“And while the current environment will create disruption for the industry in the near term, we continue to believe in the strong core fundamentals and growth outlook of the [Medicare Advantage] MA industry, and our ability to effectively compete in MA market remains intact,” he said.Regarding 2025, Broussard said the company expected benefit levels, planned stability and choice for seniors to be negatively impacted by the final MA rate notice, ""which is not sufficient to address their current medical cost trend environment and regulatory changes.""Story continuesSeveral Wall Street analysts adjusted their stock price targets for Humana after the earnings report.Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn lowered the firm's price target on the company's shares to $370 from $415 while keeping an outperform rating on the stock.The firm said Humana handily topped first-quarter expectations and maintained the full-year 2024 guidance, highlighted by improving inpatient care trends in March and leading to an in-line medical loss ratio, or MLR, without any contribution from favorable fourth-quarter repayments for rehab services that seems likely.Analyst sees acquisition potentialLooking forward, management pulled its 2025 growth guidance of $6 to $10 earnings per share due to the rate pressures and Total Beneficiary Cost (TBC) limitations and said it will return to 3% margins beyond 2026, Oppenheimer said.Overall, Humana continues to face the magnified impact of Medicare Advantage due to its significant exposure.

The firm said pulling guidance does not signal that 2025 is a no-growth year.RBC added that it is still reducing its 2025 outlook for Humana to $20.28 per share from $23.87 per share.Cantor Fitzgerald adjusted its price target for Humana to $360 from the previous target of $391, while maintaining a neutral rating on the stock.The firm’s analysts noted that while Humana has maintained its full-year MLR at 90% and its forecast of roughly $16 earnings per share there remains some uncertainty around the new guidance for 2025.On Monday, Jefferies analyst David Windley said that Cigna Group  (CI)  could resume its abandoned plan to acquire Humana after the stock prices have moved to the point where a deal makes financial sense, Bloomberg reported.The two companies reportedly discussed a cash-and-stock deal in November, but talks fell when the sides couldn’t agree on a price. But now, with Humana’s stock falling and Cigna’s climbing, an acquisition seems plausible, Windley said.“The math now works for a CI+HUM fusion,” said Windley, adding that a deal for about $420 per Humana share was possible.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024View comments (1)"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norwest-venture-partners-raises-3b-232438395.html,"Norwest Venture Partners raises $3B for 17th vehicle, maintaining fund size despite market downturn","Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 7:24 PM EDT",,"Norwest Venture Partners, a 65-year-old firm backed solely by Wells Fargo, has raised its 17th fund at $3 billion.

That's a noteworthy number, given that NVP last raised the same amount in December 2021. That was the peak of the venture boom, and at that time, the firm said it increased its capital pool by 50% (NVP's 2019 fund closed at $2 billion) because it needed to stay competitive in the dealmaking environment where round sizes and valuations have climbed to unprecedented levels.

But things have obviously changed since then. Investors are backing fewer companies, and valuations have dropped and may fall further.

Jeff Crowe, a senior managing partner, admitted that the investment rate in venture and certain sectors is slower than it was several years ago, but he said that dealmaking in certain strategies, sectors and geographies, such as growth equity, healthcare and India, is as robust as it was before the downturn.

""We've kept a very steady pace and have delivered a number of nice exits,"" Crowe told TechCrunch. ""We felt it makes sense to keep going at the same pace.""

Since closing its previous fund, the firm has helped 36 companies realize liquidity. Not all exits were great outcomes for the firm (NVP's portfolio company VanMoof filed for bankruptcy protection), but returns from certain exits greatly outweighed the losses, according to Crowe. He pointed to the firm's sale of Spiff to Salesforce, the buyout of Avetta by EQT for a reported $3 billion, and the IPO of Indian-based Five Star Business Finance.

Crowe declined to comment on returns, but said: ""This is fund 17. We've been doing this for a long time, and in the venture world, you get to stay in business if you deliver really good returns.""

NVP attributes much of its success to operating out of one large global multi-strategy fund. The firm invests in North America, India and Israel. It has an early-stage and growth equity business, and has recently added a biotech team to round out its existing healthcare practice.

The diversified approach allows the firm to adjust its strategy when the market changes. For instance, NVP planned to invest in crypto companies when it raised its last fund, but the sector fell out of favor shortly after that, and the firm didn't pursue many deals in the space.

""Our diversified strategy works well through ups and downs of investment cycles,"" Crowe said. ""It gives us flexibility. That's the beauty of it. We react faster to changes.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-us-indexes-220049761.html,Stock market today: US indexes drop as 1st-quarter GDP growth comes in weaker than expected,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 6:49 PM EDT",,"The US economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first quarter of 2024.Photo by Michael Nagle/Xinhua via Getty Images)

US stocks fell sharply Thursday as data showed the US economy grew much slower than expected to start 2024.

The report also showed consumer prices rising in the quarter, complicating the Fed's rate-cut decision.

Bond yields jumped, with the US 10-year Treasury hitting the highest in five months.

US stocks opened lower on Thursday as the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that US economic growth was weaker than expected in the first three months of this year.

US GDP grew by 1.6% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, well below expectations of 2.4% and far short of the 3.4% increase in the final quarter of 2023.

While slower economic growth could bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy, the GDP report on Thursday also showed consumer prices rising in the quarter, complicating the central bank's mission of fighting inflation without sparking an economic slowdown.

The market will be focused on personal consumption expenditures data, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which is due out on Friday.

Bond yields jumped as traders reacted to the economic data. The 10-year Treasury rose to its highest level in five months, spiking five basis points to 4.706%.

""The softer first read of Q1 GDP could shift - again- the Fed's timetable for initiating the rate easing cycle, with July coming back into play,"" Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, said after the GDP report.

""If the PCE report due tomorrow similarly suggests the downward path of inflation has begun to once again gain momentum, it could serve as a catalyst for the market.""

Meta shares dragged the wider tech sector down Thursday, with shares of the Facebook parent plunging 15% after it reported earnings results that beat estimates but delivered disappointing guidance.

Here's where US indexes stood shortly after at the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: 

S&P 500: 5,006.32, down 1.3%

Dow Jones Industrial Average: 37,929.84, down 1.4% (531 points)

Nasdaq Composite: 15,418.33, down 1.9%

Here's what else is going on: 

Trump Media has gotten Congress involved in its crusade against short sellers.

Tesla has a four-part path to generate 35% upside for its stock, Bank of America says.

Billionaire Howard Marks says AI isn't immune to a crash.

In commodities, bonds, and crypto: 

West Texas Intermediate crude oil edged up to $82.84 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, ticked up to 88.05 a barrel.

Gold rose 0.2% to $2,343.70 an ounce.

The 10-year Treasury yield rose five basis points to 4.706%.

Bitcoin fell 4% to $63,154.

Interest rate derivatives are now indicating a hike to 0.25% by October.That’s helping put the focus back on banks and other companies that may benefit from higher rates and a stronger local currency. A gauge of lenders is up 29% from a December low, nearly doubling the gain in the benchmark Topix.“Ueda will take into consideration the impact of the yen’s weakness — while a rate hike at this meeting is unthinkable, he may drop a hint of a future hike,” said Masayuki Murata, general manager of balanced portfolio investment at Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. “This is why bank shares have been rising lately.”Read More: BOJ to Stand Pat as Yen Lifts Odds of Hawkish Signals: Day GuideAfter outperforming for the past couple of years, concerns had grown that the value-stock trade had run its course with the BOJ ending its negative interest rate policy in March. The perception that the central bank will be slow to further tighten policy has also raised doubts.“A lot of investors appears to be thinking the BOJ’s tightening is done for now with the end of the negative interest rates,” said Chisa Kobayashi, Japan equity strategist at UBS SuMi TRUST Wealth Management. “But in the longer run, the BOJ is likely to head for further tightening and that seems to be overlooked.”The yen slipped beyond 155 per dollar this week for the first time in more than three decades, raising speculation that Japanese policymakers will take steps to curtail its weakness. With the impact of possible intervention seen having limited impact, the task of stemming the yen’s decline may rest on Ueda’s shoulders.Tighter policy would be a boon for banks, which benefit from higher rates on loans and investments, as well as the broader scope of value stocks. While the appeal of growth stocks is based on future earnings, value stocks are prized for their current cashflows, making them less susceptible to higher rates.Story continuesWith members including the Japanese trading houses that attracted investment from Warren Buffett as well as the banks and other old economy stocks, the value cohort has already outperformed.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-222000581.html,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Meta Platforms Stock Is Going to $565. Is It a Buy?,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 6:20 PM EDT","META
            -10.56% ","Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) delivered first-quarter financial results above expectations, but the stock tumbled after management said it was going to ramp up spending to support growth initiatives. This clouds the near-term outlook for the company's profits, which is why the stock is falling.

Bernstein lowered its price target from $590 to $565 but maintained an outperform (buy) rating on the shares. Here's why the dip could be a great buying opportunity.

Why buy Meta stock

Meta reported solid numbers across the board. Revenue grew 27% year over year, and higher margins boosted earnings per share by 114%. However, the company's investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives will come at a cost that could put the brakes on earnings growth in the near term.

Meta said it expects full-year operating expenses to be $2 billion higher than its previous forecast. It also plans to spend more on infrastructure to support AI development, which could range from $35 billion to $40 billion.

Wall Street typically likes to see higher visibility to growth in the near term, but Meta is investing for a long-term payoff. These investments are ultimately designed to benefit user engagement and business activity across its social media platforms.

Meta is still the same business it was yesterday. It has a history of accelerating capital expenditures when it sees an opportunity to grow the value of the business. The stock should recover and move toward the analyst's price target as market participants return their attention to the company's long-term growth prospects.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rate-cut-june-still-tap-221249041.html,"A rate cut in June is still on tap because the job market is weakening, Citi economist says","Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 6:12 PM EDT",,"Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell delivers remarks during a conference at the Brookings Institution in Washington.Reuters/Carlos Barria

It's still likely the Fed will issue its first rate cut this June, Citi economist Veronica Clark said.

That's because central bankers will need to support a weakening labor market, Clark told Yahoo Finance.

The job market has shown signs of weakening in some sectors, like manufacturing.

The Federal Reserve is still likely to cut rates in June in order to prop up the labor market amid a slowdown in hiring, according to Citi economist Veronica Clark.

Speaking with Yahoo Finance this week, Clark pointed to signs of weakness in the US labor market, despite robust job growth seen so far this year. The US added 303,000 payrolls last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — the third straight month of stronger-than-anticipated hiring.

But that growth could start to slow later in 2024, Clark predicted. Manufacturing employment activity continued to contract in March, a sign that hiring is already starting to weaken in some sectors. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, has inched higher in recent months, with the total jobless rate notching a 2-year-high of 3.9% in February.

""We have a base case for June still,"" Clark said of rate cuts, though she noted a July Fed rate cut was also possible. ""If anything, we think inflation is pretty sticky, but we think the Fed is looking at some of this labor market data … and really getting worried that we might be entering a weaker labor market.""

Fed officials raised interest rates 525 basis-points over the last two years. That's helped tame inflation but has raised the risk of a recession, the first signs of which could crop up in the labor market, economists have warned.

While Clark anticipates looser Fed policy, investors have pushed back on their outlook for Fed rate cuts this year after a hotter-than-expected inflation report in March. Markets are now pricing in just one or two cuts by December, according to the CME FedWatch tool, down from as many as seven rate cuts projected at the start of 2024.

Central bankers, for their part, have suggested interest rates should remain higher for longer. The Fed needs more confidence that inflation is on track to return to its 2% price target, Powell said recently, sparking a sharp pullback in stocks in this month as investors recalibrated rate-cut expectations.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/national-average-money-market-account-171030238.html,National average money market account rates for April 2024,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 5:59 PM EDT",,"A money market account is a type of savings deposit account that tends to offer check-writing privileges and a debit card for ATM access to your savings. Typically, savings accounts usually don’t let you write checks from the account, making money market accounts a unique option to store and tap your money when you need it.This article provides the most up-to-date average money market account annual percentage yield, which is 0.47 percent, and insight as to why knowing the average money market account rate is important. It’s easy to earn a much higher return than the average money market account rate by shopping around.The Federal Reserve directly impacts money market account rates at competitive banks. Generally, you’ll find that Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) bank rate increases follow the Fed’s movements. But a Fed rate increase isn’t a guarantee that a bank will raise rates.That’s why you have to compare rates to find the right account for your financial needs.And beyond yields, you’ll want to make sure a money market account has the features that you’re looking for. Check-writing privileges, ATM access, mobile check deposit and a highly-rated app are the features people tend to look for.Except for the potential for check writing, a money market account and a high yield savings account are nearly similar. So it’s also worth considering opening a high interest savings account in your search for a money market account.You might be rewarded for depositing more money in a money market accountSome money market accounts give you a higher APY for carrying a larger balance. These accounts, called jumbo money market accounts, are worth looking into if you’re looking to deposit a large sum into a liquid account. Always make sure you’re following the FDIC’s rules and guidelines to make sure that your money is protected in the event of a bank failure.Latest average money market account APYs for the past 3 monthsDateMoney market account national average APY4/22/20240.47%4/15/20240.46%4/8/20240.47%4/1/20240.47%3/25/20240.48%3/18/20240.48%3/11/20240.48%3/4/20240.47%2/26/20240.47%2/19/20240.46%2/12/20240.47%2/5/20240.47%1/29/20240.47%1/22/20240.46%1/15/20240.48%1/8/20240.46%1/1/20230.47%12/25/20230.47%12/18/20230.46%How we calculate the national average interest ratesIn June 2023, Bankrate updated its methodology that determines the national average CD rates. More than 500 banks and credit unions are surveyed weekly to generate the national averages. Among these institutions are those that are broadly available and offer high yields, as well as some of the nation’s largest banks.Story continuesCompare current money market account rates for April 2024Vio Bank — 5.30% APYUFB Direct — 5.25% APYCFG Community Bank — 5.25% APYQuontic Bank — 5.00% APYSallie Mae Bank — 4.65% APYSee additional best money market account rates.Note: Annual percentage yields (APYs) shown were updated between April 25 and May 2. Bankrate’s editorial team validates this information regularly, typically biweekly. APYs may have changed since they were last updated and may vary by region for some products. Bankrate includes only FDIC banks or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) credit unions in its listings.Bottom lineYou can easily earn more than the national average rate in a money market account. Some FDIC-insured online banks have money market accounts that either don’t require a minimum opening deposit or require a small amount to open the account. These accounts also tend to not have monthly service fees. Low or no minimum opening requirements and no fees are why you should always try and earn many times more than the average rate. But each bank is different, so compare banks to confirm the opening deposit amounts and that the account doesn’t have a monthly fee – or that it has an easy way to waive the fee if it does have one.View comments (1)"

What's more, the buy signals' tendency to generate a 3% return over the following 20 days is triple the 1% gain that has occurred during all other time periods, according to the bank.The most recent buy signal was flashed after positioning data showed a sharp decline amid this month's 5% sell-off in the broader stock market.""Our US Tactical Positioning Monitor just hit our threshold for an attractive set-up for the S&P 500, based on the fact that it dipped to -1.5z over the past 4 weeks,"" JPMorgan said.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. This was another record quarter as our strategy and focus on building deeper relationships with our clients through our one-stop shop offering continues to pay off. I believe it's a great time to be in the fixed-income trading business, macro debate is flourishing and electronification continues to take hold leaving me optimistic about our future.Even as there is consensus around rate cuts in the U.S., questions remain on the number of cuts this year, ultimate level of rates, and shape of the yield curve. In fact, Jamie Dimon, in his most recent annual letter, highlighted the potential for U.S. rates to range from as low as 2% to as high as 8%. Traders can make a lot of money with that sort of spread.While capitalizing on the array of organic growth opportunities in front of us remains our focus, we also continue to selectively use M&A to complement our offerings with the goal to create better outcomes for our clients. This year, we have deepened our penetration into the U.S. Treasury market and added new futures and algorithmic functionality with r8fin, and are adding corporates as a fourth client channel with our pending ICD acquisition. Diving into the first quarter, the momentum we saw in January persisted into February and March as we eclipsed $400 million in quarterly revenues for the first time.Specifically, strong client activity, share gains, and improved risk-appetite drove 24.1% year-over-year revenue growth on a reported basis. We continue to balance investing for growth and profitability as adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 141 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2023. Turning to Slide 5. Rates and credit led the way, accounting for 55% and 34% of our revenue growth, respectively.Record revenues across rates were primarily driven by organic growth across global government bonds and swaps and were also supplemented by the addition of r8fin and Yieldbroker. Similarly, record revenues across credit were led by strong U.S. and European corporate credit, with record quarterly market share in electronic U.S. investment grade being a highlight.Money markets also hit a record fueled by continued growth in institutional repos. Equities also hit a record despite challenging industry volumes in our core ETF business. Finally, market data revenues were driven by growth in our LSEG market data contract and proprietary data products. Turning to Slide 6.I will provide a brief update on two of our focus areas, U.S. Treasuries and ETFs, and then turn it over to Tom who will dig deeper into U.S. credit and global interest rate swaps. Starting with U.S.Treasuries, record first quarter revenues increased by 22% year over year led by records across our institutional and wholesale businesses. Our institutional business saw growing adoption of our streaming and RFQ+ offering. The leading indicators of the institutional business remains strong. We gained share and achieved record quarterly market share of U.S.Treasuries versus Bloomberg. Client engagement was healthy with institutional average daily trades up 40% year over year. Automation continues to be an important theme with institutional U.S. Treasury AiEX average daily trades increasing by more than 80% year over year and over 50% of our institutional tickets utilizing our AiEX functionality.Our wholesale business featured record volumes across our streaming and session protocols. Our recent acquisition of r8fin is off to a strong start, contributing approximately 1.5% to our overall U.S. Treasury market share complementing our CLOB and streaming protocols. While the central limit order book continued to face tougher market conditions, the team remains focused on onboarding more liquidity providers over the coming quarters as they deliver on a holistic strategy across our wholesale protocols.Within equities, our ETF business saw its second-highest quarterly revenues which were up 1% year over year despite challenging industry volumes. Other initiatives to expand our equity brand beyond our flagship ETF franchise continue to bear fruit. First quarter equity derivatives revenues were up 10% year over year, driven by strong equity futures growth. Looking ahead, the client pipeline remains strong as the benefits of our electronic solutions continue to resonate.We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term secular ETF growth story, not just in equities, but across our fixed-income business. With that, I will turn it over to Tom.Tom Pluta -- PresidentThanks Billy. Turning to Slide 7 for a closer look at another record-breaking quarter for credit. Strong double-digit revenue growth was driven by 37% and 46% year-over-year revenue growth across U.S. and European Credit, respectively.Munis produced mid-single-digit growth, while credit derivatives revenues were more muted given softer industry volumes. Automation continued to surge with global credit AiEX average daily trades increasing by about 70% year over year. We set another fully electronic quarterly market share record in U.S. IG helped by record IG block market share.Our institutional business continues to scale to new highs as clients engage with our diverse set of protocols to optimize execution across a variety of market environments. Our primary focus on growing institutional RFQ continues to pay off with ADV growing 29% year over year, with strong double-digit growth across both IG and high yield. Moreover, Portfolio trading ADV rose over 70% year over year with IG portfolio trading reaching record levels. Our clients continue to get more sophisticated in their usage of PT, with 65% of our PT volume done in-comp.These in-comp volumes grew 85% year over year. Retail credit revenues were up almost 40% year over year as financial advisors have started to turn their focus toward credit in recent months to complement their buying of U.S. Treasuries. AllTrade produced a record quarter with over $200 billion in volume.Specifically, our all-to-all volumes grew over 15% year over year and our dealer-RFQ offering grew almost 40% year over year. The team continues to be focused on broadening out our network and increasing the number of responses on the AllTrade platform. In the first quarter, the average number of responses per all-to-all inquiry rose by over 45% year over year. We also continue to increase our engagement and wallet share with ETF market makers.Finally, our sessions ADV grew over 65% year over year and saw another record revenue quarter. Looking ahead, U.S. credit remains our biggest focus area and we like the way we are positioned across our three client channels. We believe we have a long runway for growth with ample opportunity to innovate alongside our clients.Our strategy is focused on expanding our network, increasing our wallet share, enhancing our pre and post-trade analytics, and continuously improving our protocols and client experience. In the first quarter, we continued to strategically expand our sales force to broaden our coverage and attract clients we have historically not had a presence with. With respect to high yield, we continue to chip away and believe we should be able to replicate the success we have seen in IG as we leverage our Aladdin collaboration to grow our all-to-all network later this year, enhance functionality, and increase our presence with ETF market makers. Beyond U.S.credit, our EM expansion efforts continue to progress with the opening of new offices in Miami and Dubai and a steady increase in engagement with local clients. On the product side, we are focused on enhancing our integration with FXall and continuing to build out functionality for multi-asset package trading. Moving to Slide 8, global swaps produced record revenues, driven by a combination of strong client engagement in response to the macro environment and continued market share gains. Strength here was partially offset by an 8% reduction in duration and elevated quarterly compression activity.All in, global swaps revenues grew 35% year over year and market share rose to 22% with record share across other G-11 and EM-denominated currencies. Finally, we continue to make progress across emerging markets swaps and our rapidly growing RFM protocol. Our first quarter EM swaps revenues more than doubled year over year and we believe there is still significant room to grow given the low levels of electronification. Our RFM protocol saw average daily volume rise over 130% year over year with adoption picking up, especially across our European swaps business.Looking ahead, we believe the long-term swaps revenue growth potential is meaningful. With the market still about 30% electronified, we believe there remains a lot we can do to help digitize our clients' manual workflows while the global fixed-income markets and broader swaps market grow. And with that, let me turn it over to Sara to discuss our financials in more detail.Sara Furber -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Tom, and good morning. As I go through the numbers, all comparisons will be to the prior-year period, unless otherwise noted. Slide 9 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. As Billy recapped earlier, this quarter we saw record revenues of $409 million that were up 24.1% year over year on a reported basis and 23.8% on a constant-currency basis.Stepping back, looking at revenue this quarter, we generated similar average daily revenue growth with March being the strongest across all three months. We derived approximately 38% of our first quarter revenues from international customers, and recall that approximately 30% of our revenue base is denominated in currencies other than dollars, predominantly in euros. Our variable revenues increased by 30% and total trading revenues increased by 24%. Total fixed revenues related to our four major asset classes were up 7.3% on a reported and 6.9% on a constant-currency basis.The fixed subscription fee increase was primarily driven by the addition of new dealers and customers to the rates platform, as well as pricing increases on some of our rates subscription services. Credit fixed revenue growth was driven by the previously disclosed dealer fee increases, which we instituted at the start of the third quarter of 2023. And other trading revenues were down 5%. As a reminder, this line fluctuates as it reflects revenues tied to periodic technology enhancements performed for our retail clients.This quarter's adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.7% increased by 128 basis points on a reported basis when compared to the 2023 full-year margins. Moving on to fees per million on Slide 10 and a highlight of the key trends for the quarter. You can see Slide 16 of the earnings presentation for additional detail regarding our fee per million performance this quarter. For cash rates products, fees per million were up 1%, primarily due to an increase in the European government bond fees per million.For long-tenor swaps, fees per million were down 18%, primarily due to an increase in compression, as well as an 8% decline in duration. For cash credit, average fees per million decreased 4% due to a mix shift away from high yield and munis. For cash equities, average fees per million decreased by 15% due to a reduction in U.S. ETF fee per million given an increase in notional per share traded.Recall in the U.S., we charge per share and not for notional value traded. Finally, within money markets, average fees per million decreased 6%, driven by a mix shift away from higher fee per million U.S. CDs and toward our growing institutional repo business. Slide 11 details our adjusted expenses.At a high level, the scalability and variable nature of our expense base allows us to continue to invest for growth and grow margins. We have maintained a consistent philosophy here. Adjusted expenses for the first quarter increased 19.5% on a reported basis and 18.3% on a constant-currency basis. Compensation costs increased 24.7% due to increases in performance-related compensation and headcount.Technology and communication costs increased 21.3%, primarily due to our previously communicated investments in data strategy and infrastructure. Professional fees decreased 17.6% mainly due to a decrease in periodic regulatory and compliance requests relative to the first quarter of 2023. We expect professional fees to rebound over the course of the year and grow over time as we spend more on technology consulting to support our organic growth. General and administrative costs increased due to a pickup in marketing and well as a decline in FX gains year-on-year.Movements in FX resulted in a $900,000 gain in the first quarter of 2024 versus a $1.3 million gain in first quarter of 2023. Slide 12 details capital management and our guidance. On our cash position and capital return policy. We ended the first quarter in a strong position with $1.54 billion in cash and cash equivalents and free cash flow reached approximately $651 million for the trailing 12 months.Recall we recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ICD for $785 million, subject to customary adjustments, pending customary closing conditions and regulatory reviews. Our net interest income of $19.3 million increased due to a combination of higher cash balances and interest yields. This was primarily driven by the higher interest rate environment and more efficient management of our cash. With this quarter's earnings, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per Class A and Class B shares.Turning to guidance for 2024. Given the strong start to the year, we now expect adjusted expenses to trend close to the top end of our previously communicated $755 million to $805 million range for 2024. We continue to believe we can drive margin expansion compared to 2023, although it will be more modest compared to last year since we expect to capitalize on the anticipated healthy revenue environment by accelerating investments to support our current and future organic growth. We expect our capex spend to increase as the year progresses into our previously communicated range.Now I'll turn it back to Billy for concluding remarks.Billy Hult -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Sara. We have always recognized that we occupy a very important piece of desktop real estate connecting liquidity providers to their most important clients. The markets we live and breathe in remain dynamic, and we continue to work very hard alongside our clients to innovate and push the boundaries of what can be traded electronically. Our sales and tech teams remain busy, and strategically, I feel good about the road ahead and durability of our one-stop-shop value proposition.With a couple of important month-end trading days left in April, which tend to be our strongest revenue days, overall revenue growth is trending in excess of 40% relative to April 2023, driven, in part, by a favorable year-over-year comparison due to a temporary risk-off environment fueled by the regional banking crisis in the prior-year period. Revenue growth this month is also being helped by a few more trading days. Focusing on average daily revenue, we are trending close to the first quarter as momentum in the business continues. The diversity of our growth remains a theme.We are seeing strong volume growth across global government bonds, mortgages, interest rate swaps, corporate credit and repos. Our IG and high yield share are both higher than March levels with IG currently at record levels. As we focus on our future, we recently expanded our executive leadership team, adding Ashley Serrao who you all know well; and Michael Cohen, our global head of marketing and communications. Both these leaders have made a significant impact on our company, and we look forward to their future contributions.I would also like to welcome Lisa Opoku to our board of directors, who joined our board as of March 7th. Lisa brings nearly 30 years of finance and legal experience to the board while also increasing our board's independence and diversity. We look forward to benefiting from her valuable insight and industry experience. Finally, I would like to conclude my remarks by thanking our clients for their business and partnership in the quarter, and I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts that contributed to our record quarterly revenues at Tradeweb.With that, I will turn it back to Ashley for your questions.Ashley Serrao -- Head of Treasury, FP&A, and Investor RelationsThanks, Billy. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question only. Feel free to hop back in the queue and ask additional questions at the end. Q&A will end at 10:30 a.m.Eastern Time. Operator, you can now take our first question.Questions & Answers:OperatorThank you. One moment for our first question, please. Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.Alex Blostein -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystHey, good morning, Billy. Good morning, everybody. Great to see diversity in the business and the growth, but I wanted to zone in on the interest rate swap business, which continues to be obviously quite active here. And I guess the growth is not all sort of coming from compression trading, as maybe we've seen over the last couple of quarters.So help us maybe unpack a little bit the key drivers of recent growth and how you're thinking about this business for the rest of the year from here.Billy Hult -- Chief Executive OfficerSure. Alex, how are you? Happy spring, and thanks for the question. Alex, if we were going to – I like to always start with a little bit of a half a step back as, you know. If we were going to sort of paint a picture on from our perspective, not just on how to really build a business, but really grow it and become the leader in a business.From our perspective, I really feel like the swap business would paint a pretty good picture for us. It would be plant the flag early in a large, opaque, non-transparent market. When regulation starts moving in that direction, don't be a bystander, really work with the regulators and shape that regulation in a way that works for the most important clients and then leverage the network. And I kind of say that very strongly leverage the network.And so the advantage for us, as you know, in swaps has always been this giant network of mortgage customers who are huge consumers of swaps that we have, very strong network of U.S. government and European government clients, particularly on the hedge fund side. We're very active in the swaps market. So leverage that network and then continue to invest and innovate.Invest in regions. So a lot of the investments that we have put into place around EM has paid off for us, Alex. And then work with clients and innovate on what we describe as micro-trading protocols. So from our perspective, the protocol request for market has been a market share driver and a big driver of revenue.So those two factors alone are responsible for 50% of our revenue growth over the past two years. We've gone from basically making $220 million in our global swaps business in 2021 to $300 million in 2023, and feeling really good where the trajectory of that business is going in 2024. So a lot of enthusiasm for us, we see a lot of potential. We quote the big stat that 70% of the swaps business is still done via voice markets.We see that as large-size trades, we see that as partly the wholesale market where we still have a big area of focus there and we're still early in the penetration of electronic solutions across EM, I think inflation swaps, swaptions and then how we describe multi-asset packages. So we're going to keep our focus. It's been a big business for us over the past few years and it's a story that we're going to continue to tell very strongly because I think it paints a very strong picture about how we've arrived in a leadership position in that space. And thanks for the question, Alex.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.Patrick Moley -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. So you've made a number of value-add bolt-on acquisitions in recent years. ICD may be a little larger than the others, but we're just hoping to get your updated thoughts on how we should think about the M&A strategy going forward.And then if I could just add a second piece to that, ICD obviously adds an entirely new client segment in corporates. So could you just talk about how that might impact your approach to evaluating potential targets in the future? Thanks.Billy Hult -- Chief Executive OfficerSure. Hey, Patrick, how are you? Thanks for the question. I don't want to say we have our hands full right now. It's maybe not quite the perfect way to describe it, but we're focused with a capital F focused really on two things.It's maximizing our organic growth potential, first and foremost, and then the value of our recent acquisitions. And I think you framed it really well, we announced three deals in the past year. The good news from our perspective is our growth is really kind of firing on all cylinders. And both r8fin and Yieldbroker are from our perspective, progressing very, very well.And I say this in a strong way very much looking forward to ICD being part of the Tradeweb family, feeling very, very good about the strategy there and our ability to integrate going forward. Longer-term view, it's always important for the company to continue to place these bets on the table, improving the client experience, increasing our earnings power. These are kind of blueprints for us. And so with respect to future deals, we're going to continue to evaluate expansion areas for growth across geographies, clients, and products.And that's become our playbook. I'm going to kick it to Sara for some important details. And we lead always with the concept of how important it is for the culture to fit us. And that is one of the reasons why we feel good about the acquisitions over the past year, and particularly around our recent one.We feel there's a very, very strong cultural fit there, which matters to us a lot.Sara Furber -- Chief Financial OfficerGreat. I mean, I think you covered it really well. I would say just emphasizing what Billy said, the framework doesn't change, obviously, looking at strategic fit and discipline, financial fit discipline, and then also going to be measured in terms of operationally making sure that we have the bandwidth and are digesting. That said, ICD, once it closes, does open a new client channel for us.And obviously, we're focused on that integration. But we think we're going to use all our tools in the toolkit to ultimately grow our overall platform, and that will be organic and inorganic. And we do think overall corporate treasurer is an underserved market. So we like the long-term ability to layer on different pieces of the puzzle there.I would say just one other thing, we've talked a lot about acquisitions. I would say when we think about inorganic, we do think about the range of tools in the toolkit. And so we do look at partnerships, we do look at smaller investments. And one area that doesn't actually conflict in terms of integration and operational bandwidth, we are spending more time just researching emerging technologies, much smaller financial commitments in that space that we want to look at to make sure that we're building out a platform across the full suite of things in terms of where the market goes.So thanks for the question and good to hear from you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bond with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open.Andrew Bond -- Rosenblatt Securities -- AnalystHey, thanks. Good morning. So on the last call, you talked a bit about the pace of margin expansion moderating from here. Sara, you talked a little bit about that in your prepared remarks today.So can you frame what kind of margin expansion opportunity you still see for the company over time, given your current growth rates? And maybe what do you see as Tradeweb's steady state for EBITDA margin?Sara Furber -- Chief Financial OfficerGreat. Hi, Andrew. Nice to hear from you. Obviously like -- and I've talked about this, we feel like our business is still growing and our platform is still growing, and we are confident we can grow margins from here.Given that many of our businesses are still scaling where we are on that spectrum, I think it's too early to really quote or determine what the steady-state margin opportunity is. Our focus right now, particularly in the environment that we're in, is around entering new markets, expanding the platform, and investing in new opportunities. And I think the great news is we see a lot of interesting opportunities to accelerate our investment, which we talked about and really drive durable, profitable revenue growth over the long term. So, you've seen us and we've talked about investing in areas like EM more on credit sales as we have momentum there.Automation and algo there is a lot of organic opportunities, but you've also seen us deploy capital for acquisitions, and we're going to continue to put investment dollars behind those, whether it be Yieldbroker, ultimately ICD or r8fin which we think we can leverage that technology in other markets. So I think, I know everybody wants like a very specific number, but I just think it's – the good news is it's too early. I think our business really is on that growth horizon for several years to come. What I can be clear about and I think you've seen us do have a good track record here is while we're focused on all these areas of investment, we care about profitability.And so you should expect us to grow our margins slowly and steadily and have them trend higher, particularly as we look around making decisions. These are decisions that we all think add to the margin expectation over time. And then lastly, I've talked about this. Even in environments that can be more volatile, we have a lot of control over our expense base and so a fair bit of discretion and variable expenses.So that allows us to kind of have that extra bit of confidence around delivering for our shareholders.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Citi. Your line is now open.Chris Allen -- Citi -- AnalystHey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to circle back on interest rate swaps and compression activity specifically. Maybe if you could just provide some color on what kind of customers are coming in for compression trading, customers that are just coming in for compression trading. Are you making any progress in broadening out the wallet of those customers to capture risk trades? And kind of where are you with that progress?Tom Pluta -- PresidentHi, Chris. Good morning. Good to hear from you. It's Tom.So, yes, compression trading ebbs and flows during the normal course of business, clients put risk on and then they manage out old risk through compressions. And both clients and dealers find it a very efficient tool to reduce derivative notional balances. The biggest players are the macro hedge funds and they can drive large amounts of the volume, so they continue to be big drivers. We have been broadening out and increasing the number of participants in the compression protocols, so it's all been a very positive story.Now to your question about how that relates to risk trading, what we've learned is that our most active compression clients become very sticky to the platform and they've also been significantly growing their volumes of risk traits with us, which are, as you know, more profitable. Last quarter, we did have some charts in the investor presentation that highlighted this powerful correlation as well. And the key takeaways from that are in the charts last time, our top five to 10 compression clients have not only had very significant growth in compression volumes but also very large growth in their risk trading volumes as well. So those clients moved up very significantly in the rankings with us in risk trading.So we think that compression continues to be a very useful tool and very complementary and additive protocol to our overall swaps business. Thanks for the question.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.Kyle Voigt -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- AnalystHi. Good morning. So you called out adoption of RFQ trading as being a key driver of credit volume growth in the quarter and in March specifically. And I think in the prepared remarks, you noted success on both the institutional RFQ and dealer RFQ side.Just more broadly speaking, just wondering if you could talk about why you're having success with that RFQ protocol right now. What is resonating with these end clients across both the institutional and dealer segments? Is it price, capabilities or something else driving the outsized growth on the platform?Billy Hult -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Hey, Kyle. It's Billy. It's a good question because as you know really well, it sometimes feels like when you talk about credit, it's like the world gets divided between portfolio trading and alt to all trading, and those kind of pick up the kind of big headlines, but those are kind of headlines sometimes.And we feel like RFQ trading is really in a pretty straightforward way our biggest tangible opportunity in credit right now. It's a foundational protocol that you have to get really right to be in the flow of things. So that's like a huge, huge area of focus for us. And so when we think about that RFQ world, we think about first and foremost the institutional side, where we've been kind of growing our volumes there really now for years as our network expands and our efforts to kind of cross-sell pay off.I say this in a pretty simple way. We're building deeper and stronger relationships with our clients. And part of that has been, from our perspective, getting things right, adding value around portfolio trading, adding value around the alt to all network. And then sometimes what happens in a very straightforward way is then you wind up getting that RFQ volume.It's like you've kind of earned that type of business. And that's been a big kind of area of growth for us. Dealer RFQ, which is a sort of change in market structure, is a more recent initiative for us. So still in early stages of building that protocol, but we feel given the relationships we have with the dealers, with the banks that the momentum there is quite promising.So answer your questions for a second on some numbers. RFQ activity increased almost 30% for us, dealer RFQ almost 40% in the first quarter. So we're getting really into some big numbers. And a little bit technically on the RFQ side, we continue to sort of make the investments and the enhancements that you would expect us to make some of those quite bespoke for specific clients.It continues to kind of resonate with the broader market. It's a big area of investment for us, huge growth potential. And I kind of emphasize this point to you. You start to get some of that after you've added some of these efficiencies that we've talked a lot about in terms of portfolio trading and rounding out our liquidity and alt to all trading.Then all of a sudden you start to get some real kind of momentum in terms of the client activity. So thanks very much, Kyle, for your question. Appreciate it.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Your line is now open.Ben Budish -- Barclays -- AnalystHi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe, I think, circling back, I think it was Patrick's question on M&A, just can you maybe give an update on r8fin? You've owned the asset for about a quarter now. Any updated thoughts on what Tradeweb can do to sort of accelerate that business? What's sort of the potential upside from now having access to that futures trading workflow, having had a little bit more time owning the asset? Thank you.Tom Pluta -- PresidentHi, Ben. Good morning. Yes, so as Billy and Sara mentioned, we remain very excited about this asset and the opportunity for growth, which nicely complements our existing businesses. As mentioned in the prepared remarks, the acquisition is off to a very strong start and already contributing about 1.5 percentage points to our U.S.treasury market share. So that's very significant volumes starting day one. Over the last quarter, we spent a lot of time engaging with the r8fin client base, working on full integration into the Tradeweb infrastructure. And our focus ahead will be on onboarding more Tradeweb clients to r8fin, which will add to an already very rapid pace of client growth that existed before we got involved.So there's a lot of momentum on the client side and the feedback that we're getting from existing clients and prospective clients is extremely positive. We now have a market-leading technology offering that's allowing us to capitalize on growing demand for intelligent execution of multi-legged orders across cash treasuries and treasury futures. This access to U.S. bond futures is a nice compliment to the rest of our rate products.I think you heard us talking about finding ways to get involved in that space. And now we are. As far as what's ahead to your question there, looking forward, there is a lot of excitement outside of the U.S. on this acquisition as well, and our plans include expanding into new markets with European cash and futures and potentially swaps likely next on the agenda.So we see growth in the U.S. with the existing products and international expansion coming in the relatively near future. Thanks for the question.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.Michael Cyprys -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back on the Aladdin integration for the credit business. I was hoping you can update us on the progress there.Maybe just remind us what exactly is going to be changing in terms of what customers will have access to, that they didn't have access to previously. And how do you think about the opportunity set? And if there's any sort of lessons learned from the integration on the rate side that occurred years ago if I'm not mistaken.Billy Hult -- Chief Executive OfficerSure, I'll take that one as well. So the Aladdin partnership remains an important component of our growth strategy and credit and a significant part of our plan of expanding our network, particularly in high yield. We've made great progress and have been working through the three phases of this integration. So in Phase 1, we completed that in the second half of last year, and that was focused on getting dealer access and inventory data into Aladdin.Phase 2, we recently completed, and that allows Aladdin clients to respond to auto inquiries right from their Aladdin dashboard. And in Phase 3, clients will be able to initiate an RFQ on Tradeweb from within Aladdin and then also use our automation tools. So we expect, we're progressing – we expect all phase of this to be completed over the next 12 months. And as far as the results for us on volumes, revenue, and market share, we expect this to be a steady progression as we move forward with more clients within Aladdin using Tradeweb functionality.So your question on lessons learned, yes, we integrated with Aladdin in rates a number of years ago. And the main lesson there is really that Aladdin is a very important tool for many asset managers and being partnered with them and providing easier access for those clients to Tradeweb is beneficial to us and growing our volumes. We learned that in rates. That's what we're expecting and learning and seeing in credit as well.Thanks for the question.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.Dan Fannon -- Jefferies -- AnalystThanks. Good morning. I guess sticking with you, Tom, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks about looking to replicate the success and invest in high grade and high yield. And I think Aladdin to your previous response as part of that, but maybe you can elaborate on what you expect on other things you're doing and really kind of a time period you think to gauge the success of the potential share gains?Tom Pluta -- PresidentSure. So in high yield, the goal is to continue to build out the client network, and we have been doing that. Billy mentioned we're hiring salespeople to help build out that client footprint and we have been making notable progress. We're also building out the dealer network, and you can see in the stats on the increase in the number of responses, clients will come on the system, but ultimately, they want liquidity, and they want a lot of responses and they're getting that.As Aladdin functionality rolls out, as I mentioned, over the course of the year, this will continue to boost high-yield volume. So there's no time frame as far as when we're there and when we're done, but it's more a continuum, and we do expect to continue to grow our share over time. And this is a very sustained effort. It's blocking and tackling.It's getting clients to come over to Tradeweb for the first time and we are getting there. So that's what we're going to continue to do. Thanks for the question.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.Craig Siegenthaler -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGood morning, everyone. Our question is on pricing and credit. So as competition here in credit continues to intensify, how are you thinking about pricing over the long term? And in your discussions with buy-side clients, is this becoming a more relevant topic? Thank you.Billy Hult -- Chief Executive OfficerHey, Craig. It's Billy. Thanks very much. We'd be crazy to say that pricing isn't part of the conversation with our clients.And if I didn't say that the right way, it would be when this call was over, right. It's a big part of the reality. That being said, we say this in a very kind of blunt way. It's not the main focus, right? Clients are focused on being able to do their job more efficiently and more intelligently.And it's important for us to always appreciate that when clients think about value, that we provide, it goes just a lot past that sort of execution fee. It starts with liquidity and functionality, but it stretches to pre-trade analytics, and really how we describe this like flow of information and Tom was talking about Aladdin but this flow of information to OMSs. And so the convenience of trading multiple products from a single platform, that's a big deal, that one-stop shop sort of emphasis that we continue to kind of make. I say this again in my – in sort of a little bit of my own language.If pricing was the main focus, our largest competitor in institutional rates market would have all that business. And if it was the main focus, we'd be the full leader in the credit market, right? So these are kind of complex dynamics, sometimes with a complex dynamic, you simplify, right? Simple strategy, continue to provide our clients with more innovation or bang for the buck, and pricing conversations always take care of themselves. And I don't say that flippantly. I say that with a lot of rigor in terms of the analysis.So we're going to continue to innovate with protocols, connecting our markets. We believe we provide a lot of value to our clients, and we have that loyalty and support, and we feel quite good about where our pricing model is today. It's a good question, Craig, thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.Ken Worthington -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- AnalystHi. Good morning, everybody. Congrats, Ashley. On high yield, connection with ETF managers seems like a no-brainer to me for Tradeweb and high yield.How big a part of the high-yield trading ecosystem are ETFs? How is rebalancing and high-yield ETFs done currently? And what needs to happen for Tradeweb to win more business in that part of the market?Tom Pluta -- PresidentHey, Ken, good morning. Yes, high yields, I should say, ETF market makers and ETF volumes coming into the cash markets continue to be a significant part of what we're seeing and a significant part of our growth strategy. We've also seen ETF market makers using portfolio trading to replicate some of those baskets. So I think us having the full range of protocols, a thorough ETF market offering, strengthen portfolio trading, RFQ, and the cash bonds, all complement one another.So as far as what has to continue to happen, we continue to work on all of these protocols, building out the network, building out the responses, building out the volume and what we've seen increasingly is these players interacting across the various protocols, and we're working on ways to try to make it easier for clients to access those protocols within Tradeweb in terms of doing more than one trade or doing a package of trades at one time. So we're focused on all those things. The results have been quite promising, and it's a big part of the focus going forward. Thanks for the question.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.Brian Bedell -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.Most have been asked and answered, but maybe just one on your views on the potential clearing of treasuries, new regulations coming around and I realize it's still potentially a couple of years out, but how do you see that changing the landscape for Tradeweb in any major way and are there opportunities for you to expand your business with that new paradigm.Tom Pluta -- PresidentSure, Brian. So just to recap, the SEC did announce the final clearing rules in December and set the deadlines for the end of 2025 for cash treasuries and mid-2026 for treasury repo. In cash treasury, essentially the rule will scope in more dealers, essentially the PTFs to clear their trades. But this rule fell short of scoping an even wider variety of market participants that some had expected.So it's not as dramatic in cash treasuries. In treasury repo that is the bigger change. So substantially all of the market will be required to clear repo going forward or essentially clear repo going forward. There's a few exclusions out there, but it is most of the market.I guess what I would highlight is that there's still a number of open questions that the industry is wrestling with such as, will there be other clearing houses other than FICC entering the space as competitors and one or more have suggested that they will enter. And then what are the specifics of the protocols that are introduced by clearing houses with respect to cross margining and netting and things that. And then is there enough capacity for bank dealers who are sponsoring a large number of clients into the clearing houses and how those margin costs we shared? So these are the types of things that are being discussed in the market, being discussed in the panels. And then how might that impact liquidity? So these details are still being worked out.But ultimately, your question is what's the impact to Tradeweb? Generally speaking, more central clearing is positive for our business. It does go hand-in-hand with electronification. And as we are a large player in critical infrastructure provider in the treasury and repo markets, we're already fully connected to FICC. We already manage clear treasury business today through Dealerweb.We're very familiar with how all that works. And as these deadlines approach, we're going to work closely with our clients and help them navigate the rule changes as we've done in interest rate swaps. So mild positive, not a dramatic change, but this direction of travel in the regulation continues to be supportive for Tradeweb.Billy Hult -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd our ability to have a voice around how this regulation ultimately gets implemented in the market. From my perspective, there's some pretty good feelings about that because it mimics a little bit the way that we were able to kind of get in there around, as you guys all know very well, the derivatives regulation and how SEFs reform and very important decisions that were made around really how clearing would work and the market structure of that market that gives us now, again, a bunch of years later, confidence, but also the credibility to be in there with the right people and really shape how that regulation winds up really affecting the markets that we live and breathe in. So that's a big part of this and Tom answered that perfectly.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.Alex Kramm -- UBS -- AnalystHey, hello, everyone. Just wanted to come back on the discussion we had earlier about RFQ. Sounds like you're being successful there. But I know there's limited disclosures.But when I look at some of the foundational RFQ numbers that you give every quarter, I think over the last 10 quarters, you're kind of stuck in the low to high 4% market share of trade. Now that's combined high yield in IG. So I don't know if that's a fair way to look at it. But doesn't seem like you've been really able to break out, and I think 1Q was actually down a little bit over the – from the last few quarters.So just wondering if we're looking at this right, is there's still a lot to do, and what there is to do because it seems like you've been stuck a little bit. So just maybe rectify that a little bit. Thanks.Billy Hult -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. How are you? I made the sort of analogy about the painting to the first question that Alex from Goldman asked me, I'm not saying you're going to like smudge our Picasso, but I kind of hear where you're coming from. I think at the end of the day, as we talk about sort of where we're headed with RFQ trading and the real significant progress that we've made around that and the emphasis around that. At the end of the day, the success around that has been, I think, higher around kind of IG.And we're pretty blunt here. I think we do a lot of things very, very well. We still have more work to do on high yield. And some of that work is around the penetration of RFQ trading into high yield.But from our perspective, also it's about the adoption of portfolio trading into the less liquid areas of the market. And it's also about, and Tom described, this work that we're doing with Aladdin in terms of increasing the responder network in high yield, that's going to be a big piece of it as well. So if you felt like just everything we do in RFQ trading would perfectly apply from IG to high yield, not so fast. It's again, the collaborative effect of really impacting the clients' workflow.And the focus in high yield have to be three-pronged. It has to be around, yes, RFQ, but also the continued confidence around portfolio trading plus rounding up this network of responders through integrations like Aladdin. So it's always a sort of pure focus that we have. It's a good question.Thanks a lot.OperatorThank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.Elias Abboud -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning. It's Elias Abboud from Craig's team. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned earlier that you've completed Phase 2 of the Aladdin integration, which was for all-to-all trading.I was wondering if you could quantify the inflection you've seen in institutional all-to-all volume since that integration was completed. So maybe we can get a peek into what the results from Phase 3 could look like down the road. Thanks.Tom Pluta -- PresidentYes. So we've definitely made significant progress there. We don't actually break out and disclose that, but I think it's safe to say that we are making progress. We see more.It's a little bit too soon, I'd say, to see the full effect because these are still coming online. And I think we'll see more of the impact later this year and into next year, but it has been a steady growth and what's been contributing to the overall market share gains that you have – that we have been experiencing over the last year or a year and a half. Thanks for the question.OperatorThank you. And this concludes our Q&A portion. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Billy Hult for closing remarks.Billy Hult -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you all very much for joining us this morning. Any follow-up questions, obviously, always feel free to reach out to Ashley and the team. We also want to end with a little congratulations to one of our teammates, Sameer, who had a baby boy who we know is listening at home. Congratulations to Sameer.And, everyone, have a great day.

            -15.97% ","Shares of Hertz Global Holdings (NASDAQ: HTZ) were tumbling today after the car rental giant posted disappointing results in its first-quarter earnings, as the company continued to experience challenges with its EV fleet.As a result, the stock was down 19.8% as of 3:28 p.m. ET.<img alt=""A car rental sign in an airport."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Mzy5Ruqi6htRQkRC8Thrmg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYxNw--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/fc524f185ed08800defb100b36d3cdb9"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.Hertz is still short-circuitingHertz's revenue in the quarter rose 2% year over year to $2.1 billion, which topped estimates at $2.04 billion. Total transaction days rose 9% due to strength in the leisure and rideshare channels, while retail price per day fell 7% to $56.68.The big issue facing Hertz came on the cost side, as the company said it now planned to sell 30,000 EVs, up from the 10,000 it had announced earlier, as it decreases its exposure to the electric vehicle market. Hertz took a $195 million vehicle depreciation charge on the EVs held for sale, and direct operating expenses rose 3% due to inflationary pressure and damage-related expenses.On the bottom line, the company reported an adjusted net loss of $392 million, or a loss of $1.28 per share, which compared to an adjusted profit per share of $0.39 in the quarter a year ago, and estimates of a loss of $0.44 per share.CEO Gil West didn't hide from the challenges, saying of the fleet and direct operating costs, ""We're tackling both issues -- getting to the right supply of vehicles at an acceptable capital cost, while at the same time driving productivity up and operating costs down.""What's next for Hertz?Hertz didn't offer guidance in the press release, but the company should eventually overcome the EV-related headwinds, and the modest top-line growth is a positive sign.I wouldn't call this a buying opportunity yet, but Hertz should be able to bounce back over the longer term.Should you invest $1,000 in Hertz Global right now?Before you buy stock in Hertz Global, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hertz Global wasn’t one of them.

Shares of Anywhere Real Estate Inc. sank 7%, and are now down 38% this year, after the real estate services company reported first-quarter results that were weaker than consensus estimates. Industry peers including Opendoor Technologies Inc. and Redfin Corp. dropped as well.

Real estate was among the day’s weakest sectors in the S&P 500 Index after data showed the economy slowed last quarter while inflation jumped. Treasury yields surged to the highest levels this year, signaling that homebuyers aren’t about to get a reprieve from elevated borrowing costs.

While analyst said that Anywhere’s results showed a return to overall transaction growth for the first time two years, investors were more fixated on the firm’s misses when it came to earnings and revenue. It helps set the tone for a slew of announcements ahead: Peers including Zillow Group Inc. and Opendoor are slated to report in the coming weeks.

“It’s less about what they print this quarter and more about how they talk about the future,” John Campbell, an analyst at Stephens Inc., said of real estate brokerages this earnings season.

Analysts are bearish on Anywhere’s stock, with none calling it a buy, three saying hold and three recommending to sell, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

On top of high borrowing costs, there’s another force weighing on the sector: questions around commission rates after the National Association of Realtors got preliminary approval for its $418 million settlement with home sellers over commission rules for real estate agents.

The industry is also seeing a bifurcation between traditional and technology-centered brokers, according to Campbell. Digital real estate players like Zillow are gaining market share, positioning them to outperform.

            -3.30% ","Shares of semiconductor and data center infrastructure stocks Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) were all rallying today, up 3.2%, 3.2%, and 4.4%, respectively, as of 3:39 p.m. EDT.While these gains may not have been extremely eye-opening, they were in the context of the Nasdaq Composite index being down around 0.65% at that time. These three are large components of that index, so to see them defying their peers is notable.The divergence is likely due to one large tech giant significantly raising its full-year outlook for capital spending, most of which will go to artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. Fears of a large AI spending war among the very biggest tech giants caused those stocks to plunge today, but the increased spending should be a boon for these infrastructure players.Meta's spending benefits these threeLast night, Meta Platforms surprised investors with its first-quarter earnings report. While Q1 revenue and earnings beat estimates, the company also raised its 2024 guidance for capital expenditures to $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its prior forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.That big increase in spending caused Meta's stock to plunge this morning, but it's actually great news for the recipients of all that spending. In particular, Meta is known to be a huge customer of Arista Networks' data center ethernet switches. In fact, Meta was Arista's largest customer in 2023, accounting for 21% of its revenue.<img alt=""Two people walk through a data center next to a rack of servers."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xZGC69DdwU2tlOyZu9GM1A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/c82c6b05cc4231b3ae0eb68d2f486400 class=caas-img>Datacenter plays are reaping the early benefits of the AI wars. Image source: Getty Images.So, Meta's big spending should be good news for Arista. And Arista's switches use Broadcom networking chips, so the increased revenue for Arista should also filter down to Broadcom. Not only that, but Meta is also a direct customer of Broadcom's custom ASIC business, as Meta uses Broadcom IP in its own house-designed AI accelerators.On the conference call with analysts last night, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that the company was attempting to keep its AI costs in check by using more of its own data center accelerators, as opposed to Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).The good news for TSMC is that it makes both Nvidia GPUs and the new Meta AI accelerator in its foundries, with the new-generation Meta chip currently produced on TSMC's 5-nanometer process. However, Mark Zuckerberg has recently indicated he may switch to Samsung's foundry in the future, given the tensions between China and TSMC's home country of Taiwan.AI hardware is still all the rageThe Nasdaq Composite was down not only due to Meta's outsized spending but perhaps also on fears a new competitive spending race for AI supremacy will break out between all the big cloud infrastructure and internet platform companies. Zuckerberg's comment on this front didn't exactly help:Story continuesAs we're scaling capex and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently. But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.Big spending without an immediate payoff is clearly scaring investors off the big cloud companies today. However, that multiquarter or even multiyear spending race should continue to benefit chip and hardware companies like these three key players. As of now, it looks as though the immediate spoils of the AI wars will go to leading semiconductor and hardware companies and not necessarily the cloud giants -- at least in this early stage of the AI era.Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

(Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)Intel is in the midst of transforming itself from a designer and manufacturer of its own chips to a manufacturer of chips for third-party clients. So far, the company said it has six customers, including Microsoft (MSFT), which is developing its own custom chips.The first quarter marks the first time Intel is reporting earnings under its new corporate structure. The company now reports revenue from its Client Computing Group, Data Center and AI, and Network and Edge divisions under its Intel Products segment. Altera, Mobileye, and Other now report under the All Other Segment, while Intel’s Foundry business reports under Intel Foundry. In announcing the restructuring, however, Intel also revealed that its foundry business lost $7 billion in the last year.For the quarter, Intel saw Intel Products revenue of $11.9 billion, up 17% year over year on strong performance from its Client Computing Group. That segment saw revenue of $7.5 billion, up 31% thanks to a rebound in the PC market.Foundry revenue totaled $4.4 billion, down 10% year over year, while All Other revenue came in at $775 million, down 46% year over year.The move to a foundry model puts Intel into direct competition with TSMC (TSM), the world's largest chip manufacturer. But there are doubts that the third-party foundry business will ever be a significant source of revenue.Intel is looking to capitalize on the AI craze through the PC market with its new Core Ultra processors. The chips, which feature built-in neural processing units (NPUs), are designed to run AI models on your laptop, rather than in the cloud. The idea is that you can take advantage of AI apps without having to connect to the web or share your data.Story continuesAMD, Intel’s chief rival in the PC space, is also offering its own AI PC chips, while Nvidia says laptops running its chips are considered AI PCs as well. And on Wednesday, Qualcomm debuted its Snapdragon X Plus chip to go along with its previously announced Snapdragon X Elite as potential rivals to Intel and AMD.Qualcomm (QCOM) claims its chips can outpace certain Intel Core Ultra and AMD chips in terms of performance and battery life. The company’s new processors will go on sale later this year.<img alt=""Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PffxtL2jp44Irq548PJVHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ4MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-01/7bb04d80-bed4-11ee-b7b7-f9706ecb81fc class=caas-img>Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

            -2.45% ","By Yuvraj Malik, Anna Tong and Stephen Nellis(Reuters) -Microsoft beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit on Thursday, driven by gains from adoption of artificial intelligence across its cloud services, and the company's shares jumped more than 4% in extended trade.Executives forecast ranges for current quarter cloud revenue that were mostly above Wall Street targets.The rise in Microsoft shares after the bell lifted the company's stock market value by $128 billion as profit and revenue growth overshadowed its higher-than-expected capital expenditures. In contrast, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta's market capitalization fell by $200 billion on Wednesday after it warned of rising AI expenses and issued a lower-than-anticipated revenue forecast.""Microsoft’s AI-powered earnings demonstrate that doubling down on innovation is paying off,"" said Jeremy Goldman, senior director of briefings at Emarketer, pointing to the company's early moves in generative AI, such as its large investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.Microsoft revenue rose 17% to $61.9 billion in the quarter ended March, exceeding the consensus estimate of $60.80 billion, according to LSEG data. Earnings per share of $2.94 topped Wall Street's target of $2.82.At the same time, Microsoft's AI-driven capital expenditures in the third quarter were nearly $1 billion more than analysts' estimates. Capital expenditures grew from $11.5 billion in the previous quarter to $14 billion, passing estimates of $13.14 billion, according to Visible Alpha.""We're continuing to see customer demand grow quite a bit,"" Brett Iversen, Microsoft's vice president of investor relations told Reuters. ""And so we're making sure to scale our available capacity in line with that.""The stock has soared on Microsoft shipping generative AI (genAI) tools based on its strategic partnership with OpenAI and also helped it capture the world's most valuable company crown from Apple this year. Microsoft has special access to OpenAI's coveted AI technologies, which it has been working to infuse across its product portfolio, such as in Azure, Bing and also Microsoft 365, which includes Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.Revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses the Azure cloud computing platform, rose to $26.7 billion, passing the average estimate of $26.24 billion, LSEG data showed.It forecast fourth quarter intelligent cloud revenue of $28.4-28.7 billion, mostly ahead of Wall Street targets of $28.47 billion.Story continuesAzure revenue rose 31%, higher than a 29% growth estimate from market research firm Visible Alpha. Microsoft forecast Azure growth in the fiscal fourth quarter would be 30%-31%, which would put it ahead of the 28.5% Wall Street target.Microsoft does not break out the absolute revenue figure for Azure, the part of its business best situated to capitalize on booming interest in artificial intelligence.The Copilot tool, a set of genAI assistants launched in November for $30 a month, has lifted Microsoft's enterprise software and Windows businesses. A recovery in personal computer sales was also a factor.The More Personal Computing unit revenue increased 17% to $15.6 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $15.08 billion, according to data from LSEG.Productivity and Business Processes, Microsoft's unit that houses office software and LinkedIn, increased revenue 12% to $19.6 billion. Analysts had estimated $19.54 billion, according to data from LSEG.(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and David Gregorio)View comments"

Rates surged past 7% last week for the first time this year following a government report showing inflation remained hotter than expected.A separate measure, which tracks rate changes daily, revealed even bigger swings. The daily rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan was 7.52% on Thursday, the highest reading since November 2023, according to Mortgage News Daily.The uptick in rates was a sour note for would-be buyers hoping to get into the spring market, forcing some first-time and repeat buyers back on the sidelines.Any hope of seeing rates stabilize will be contingent on inflation, said Jiayu Xu, an economist at Realtor.com.“Unfortunately, the rising mortgage rates occurred during what is typically a busy time in the housing market, potentially giving pause to prospective homebuyers as they weigh their purchasing decisions,” Xu said. “Despite the increased mortgage rates leading to higher costs, it could also suggest a less competitive market where opportunities may exist for some homebuyers.”<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/16817948/embed?auto=1></iframe>Today at 2:22 PM EDT Josh SchaferAnother worrisome sign on the inflation frontNew data revealed a slowdown in the US economy in the first three months of the year. But even more concerning to investors was that inflation accelerated faster than Wall Street had expected, sending shockwaves through markets on Thursday.The latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed the ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, grew by 3.7% year-over-year in the first quarter, above estimates for 3.4%, and significantly higher than 2% gain seen in the prior quarter.This marked the first quarterly increase in the Fed's preferred inflation gauge in a year, underscoring concerns that the central bank may not cut interest rates as quickly as it has projected.""The difficult part [of Thursday's data release] for the Fed and for the markets was core PCE was the inflation print,"" Deutsche Bank senior US economist Brett Ryan told Yahoo Finance. ""And that's really what is troublesome from the Fed's perspective, and why the market reacted, you know, quite negatively because it really, it really puts the Fed in awkward position and you start to question whether they can cut at all this year.""He added that the data could have implications for a separate inflation print scheduled for release Friday. Consensus had expected a 0.3% month-over-month increase in core price in March.But Ryan notes that Thursday's reading on price increases for the quarter indicates that either March's PCE reading will be hotter than expected, or revisions will show inflation was actually higher than previously thought in January and February. Neither bodes well for rate cut prospects, which now have the market pricing in just one rate cut this year.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17719292/embed?auto=1></iframe>Today at 1:30 PM EDTAlexandra CanalPeacock losses narrow as subscribers jumpComcast (CMCSA) shares fell about 7% on Thursday following a mixed first quarter earnings report that saw domestic broadband subscribers fall year over year.But the company reported subscriber additions for its flagship streaming service Peacock, which added 3 million subs while revenue at the platform increased 54% year on year to $1.1 billion.Losses at Peacock narrowed to $639 million compared to a loss of $704 million in the prior-year period. The company previously said 2023 would be the year of ""peak losses"" at the streaming service.""We are really pleased with Peacock's trajectory,"" Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong said during the company's first quarter earnings call. ""We started the year with an incredibly successful NFL wild card game, which resulted in a nice lift to paid subs. But even more important was how our broad content offering enabled strong consumer acquisition, retention and engagement.""In total, Peacock subscribers have climbed 55% year over year to reach 34 million. The company said consumers are spending 90% of their time on the platform viewing non-sports content, which includes original scripted series like ""Ted"" and ""Apples Never Fall"" along with reality programs like ""The Traitors.""""Oppenheimer"", which premiered exclusively on Peacock in February, was the most watched film across all of streaming in its first seven days on the platform, management added.""Looking ahead, our content offering provides such a great value proposition that we should have some real pricing power over time,"" Comcast president Mike Cavanagh said.Echoing the recent moves of competitors, Peacock raised prices for the first time ever in July, hiking monthly fees by $1 to $5.99 for the ad-supported Peacock Premium plan and by $2 to $11.99 for the mostly ad-free Peacock Premium Plus tier.Read more here.Today at 12:45 PM EDTInes FerréTrending tickers on ThursdayMeta (META) Shares of the social media giant sank roughly 13%, weighing on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).

On October 27, 2022, Meta sunk an eyewatering 25% after disappointing on Q3 earnings. Yet that was an excellent entry that yielded more than a 400% return into the April 2024 all-time closing high of $527.34. The stock had been down 65% from its July 2021 peak just prior to the fall.Compare that to the even bigger decline of 26% on February 3, 2022, which occurred when the stock was only down 15% from recent highs. That was the biggest plumet in the company's history, and it would take over two years to reach fresh records.However, the stock has not rebounded so well when the stock price dropped relatively close to recent highs.

The shaky appetite for home appliances comes as the US housing market has been at a standstill, with elevated mortgage rates keeping both buyers and sellers on the sidelines.Mortgage rates have eclipsed 7% this year. Sales of existing homes pulled back last month, eroding demand for big ticker appliances, which are often purchased when people move.However, Whirlpool remains bullish on the outlook for housing in the long term.""Our positive view of the US housing market remains unchanged.

The material lift in capex guidance for this year and signals of even more aggressive spending in 2025 to support AI initiatives has rocked renewed investor confidence.JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth makes an important point in a note this morning:""We are encouraged that Meta’s success w/Llama 3 and Meta AI has increased management’s confidence in leading in AI, and we know that building out new products takes time, but comparisons to the scaling periods of Reels, Stories, and Feed into mobile will concern many investors, even as we can see those long-term payoffs.""Today at 6:30 AM EDTBrian SozziThis one chart says it all on ChipotleChipotle (CMG) is a beast.There is no other way to put it.The company raises prices by 6% to 7% in California in response to the new $20-an-hour wage law, and consumers don't push back. The company rolls out sweet and spicy chicken, consumers clamor for it. The company, at some locations, is pumping out 80 burrito bowls an hour at peak times — beyond impressive.The one chart below from Bernstein captures nicely the growth story that Chipotle continues to be (more on that here in my interview with Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol).All in all, the stock deserves to trade higher today after last night's results.For more on Chipotle, tune into my chat with Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung today on Yahoo Finance around 9:45 a.m. ET.<img alt=""There is Chipotle...and then there is everyone else."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/P5WKqDjARDladZDFfCN1Eg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/d48691d0-02e5-11ef-9b13-9a00963c8595 class=caas-img>There is Chipotle...and then there is everyone else. (Bernstein)Today at 6:15 AM EDTBrian SozziWatch the truckers and railsIt has been a rough earnings season for trucking and railroad companies.Guidance has been terrible. Earnings call commentary has been terrible.The question now for investors is if this commentary suggests an economic slowdown in the coming months, as trucking and rail companies are often seen as economic bellwethers.Here is a good recap of what's going on from the team at Jones Trading:“The S&P 1500 Road & Rail industry group was down as much as 4% yesterday intraday before settling with a 3% decline. It has not been a secret that there is a trucking glut at the moment in the United States. Last week JB Hunt (JBHT) dropped sharply after reporting earnings and stating 'we continue to face inflationary cost pressures, despite also facing deflationary pricing pressure.'""Today it was Old Dominion Freight lines (ODFL). The company's CFO stated that the past two years have felt like the 2009 recession and added that some competitors are taking shipments 'for cost or less than their cost to operate, just to kind of keep the trucks rolling.' The situation may be best summed up by Knight Swift (KNX), which negatively pre-announced last week and then today lowered guidance for the next two quarters.The weakness has carried over to the rails, where in most cases the companies appeared to just miss forecasts on the top and bottom line. Norfolk Southern (NSC) noted 'We expect continued mixed impacts from higher international empty shipments as geopolitical tensions remain elevated, but a weak truck market continues to drive stubbornly low truck rates, which will dampen domestic non-premium Intermodal pricing.' A Canadian National Railway (CNI) executive noted '...I think everyone would understand with the truck capacity issues that are out there today, there's a lot of surplus capacity. We're expecting that overall within North America to decline as more and more shops, I'll say, go bankrupt, and some of that capacity comes out of the market.' Looking for bankruptcies, ouch. The executive did note that was the only area of pricing pressure it is seeing.""Today at 6:00 AM EDTBrian SozziIBM shares tank — here's why, plus what the CFO told Yahoo FinanceBig Red.Shares of IBM (IBM) — aka Big Blue — are getting slammed premarket after earnings last night. The Street mostly likes the company's $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal. But lots of focus on the unchanged sales in the first quarter at IBM's lucrative consulting business.Here's what IBM's CFO Jim Kavanaugh told me about the HashiCorp deal and the consulting softness.Kavanaugh on HashiCorp:“The deal is a tremendous strategic fit to the new IBM of a hybrid cloud and AI company.”“I think it will be a major transformational shift for IBM that is complementary and that drives the next leg of scale of Red Hat and IBM as a hybrid cloud platform.”Kavanaugh on consulting business: “We still see very good demand out in the marketplace around large transformational deals, digital transformation. We had our largest first quarter in consulting signings in many years. So the demand profile is out there. Our AI bookings for consulting in the first quarter doubled all of 2023.

Even so, demand was fair-to-strong for this week’s more-than-$180 billion worth of Treasury auctions, a sign that investors remain inclined to treat yield surges as buying opportunities.“A lot of macro news is now embedded into the yield curve,” said George Goncalves, head of US macro strategy at MUFG.Ahead of Friday’s inflation reading, followed by the Treasury’s refunding announcement and the Fed’s meeting next week, solid auction demand “shows the market is efficient and not looking to overpay for US Treasuries yet,” he said.Read More: US Yields Soar as Traders See Fed Delaying First Cut to DecemberEconomic data earlier on Thursday was the latest to force Wall Street to temper its expectations for lower borrowing costs in the world’s top economy. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.6% annualized rate last quarter, while a closely watched measure of underlying inflation advanced at a greater-than-expected 3.7% clip.As a result, traders pared back expectations for the timing of a Fed rate reduction, fully pricing in the first cut in December. They now see only about 33 basis points of Fed rate reductions for all of 2024, well below the more than six quarter-point reductions they expected at the start of the year.“Inflation is going to end the year between 2.5% and 3.5%,” said Sinead Colton Grant, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon.Treasury yields remained elevated through the trading session as traders looked ahead to more economic indicators on Friday. The personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed’s preferred inflation measure — is projected to show the annual rate rose to 2.6% last month, from 2.5% in February. That would suggest progress toward the Fed’s 2% goal has stalled.US policymakers will then convene next week and announce an updated policy statement. Attention will likely focus on any commentary from Chair Jerome Powell on recent data and the implications for the rate path ahead. In March, Fed officials laid out a forecast of three quarter-point cuts in 2024. Employment data at the end of next week will also offer more clarity about the economy.Story continuesTo BNY’s Colton Grant, the “biggest danger” for investors is to focus on the number of rate cuts this year — and “lose sight of the big prize, which is the ability to add a better diversifier for your portfolio at a higher yield level.”The yield on benchmark two-year Treasuries rose as high as 5.02% before buyers stepped in. Yields above 4.70% in the 10-year also attracted buyersWith yields elevated, the Treasury was able to sell $44 billion of seven-year notes in line with forecasts, capping a trio of auctions that flooded the market this week.Overall, the Treasury’s sales were taken in by buyers without much fuss. An auction of two-year notes found solid demand that forced the yield below its bidding deadline, and the five-year later arrived only slightly soft.The seven-year auction, meantime, was awarded at 4.716% yield, the same level indicated in pre-auction trading at the 1 p.m. New York time bidding deadline — an indication that demand met dealer expectations. Bond dealers underwriting the seven-year auction were left with just 13.9% of the paper, below the recent average of 15.1%, according to BMO Capital Markets.--With assistance from Liz Capo McCormick and Elizabeth Stanton.(Updates to add context, prices and comments throughout.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic BoomtownsCaught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses SidesA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ LenderStudio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount MergerHow North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/often-overlooked-jobs-indicator-points-191645916.html,An Often Overlooked Jobs Indicator Points to Deep Cracks in Canada’s Labor Market,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 3:16 PM EDT",,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s job market is less robust than the country’s most closely watched employment indicator suggests.Most Read from BloombergUS Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing HopesMalaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest CityBig Tech Surges in Late Hours on Blowout Earnings: Markets WrapJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in WorldBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll ShowsData from the payroll employment survey — a census of all paid workers in Canada — indicates the country added a mere 17,000 jobs over the six-month period ending in February. That’s a far cry from the 183,800 reported in the labor force survey, which polls households and is faster to publish results.That difference of 166,800 jobs is more than 22 times the average gap between the two surveys since 2001, and has been growing for months.During the height of the pandemic in June 2020, six-month job growth in the household survey exceeded payroll growth by more than 700,000. But that gap now approaches its highest level recorded before 2020, which was 186,100 in 2012.The payroll survey relies on administrative data reported by businesses for tax purposes. It’s a direct input to the calculation of Canada’s gross domestic product.The labor force survey, on the other hand, polls about 56,000 households monthly, allowing it to provide an earlier indicator of the pulse of the job market and capture geographical and socioeconomic differences. It posted new data for March three weeks ago showing the country lost 2,200 jobs that month.A key difference between the two is that the payroll survey does not include self-employed Canadians, who drove February’s 40,700 job gain captured by the household survey.Thursday’s payroll data point in the opposite direction, recording a 17,700 job loss for that month.In general, the two surveys don’t disagree much, Fred Demers, an investment strategist at BMO Asset Management, said in an interview.“It gets interesting when you start to see a little bit of a gap opening up between the two, and then the safest thing you can do is bet on payrolls, in terms of giving you leading information about what’s going on.”While the household survey’s increase in unemployment has been driven by a growing population rather than job losses, payrolls suggest those losses may soon appear in the household data, Demers said.Self-employment and the intrinsic noise from the household survey’s small sample size may be reasons for the growing gap, he added.Story continuesDominique Lapointe, director of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, agreed that the two surveys tend to track closely in the long run.He also agreed that the household survey has converged toward payrolls in recent years, but cautioned that month-to-month volatility in the latter has been higher since the pandemic, making it harder to tell if it’s still more reliable.Lapointe noted that job growth in services has been faster in payrolls than the household numbers.“What might be happening since the middle of 2023 is services sectors in the labor force survey catching up to what is reflected in the payroll survey, especially in industries such as health care, education and public administration, which continue to see rapid hiring,” Lapointe said in an email.“What remains concerning is the lack of net private hiring since the middle of 2023 as the labor force continues to grow at a rapid pace.”The growing divergence between strength in the public sector and weakness in the private sector is at least one area where both surveys agree.Read More: Public Sector Hiring Is Driving the Labor Market in CanadaWhile the household survey has shown a gradually rising unemployment rate and even a small surprise contraction in March, Thursday’s payroll numbers back the idea that the Bank of Canada risks keeping its policy rate too restrictive for too long, a concern highlighted by some officials in the most recent summary of deliberations.Both headline and core inflation are now within the Bank of Canada’s 1% to 3% tolerance band, and retail sales are on track for no growth in the first quarter. That said, GDP growth still looks strong, supported by exports and a population surge.Policymakers next set rates on June 5. The majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey expect the bank to cut policy rates by 25 basis points at that meeting.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic BoomtownsCaught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses SidesA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ LenderStudio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount MergerHow North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments"

            -4.03% ","Shares of ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) were moving lower today after the software-as-a-service company beat estimates in its first-quarter earnings report but offered revenue guidance for the full year that was slightly below analyst expectations. Additionally, there may be concerns about its valuation getting stretched after the stock had run up in the last several months, so it was easy for a slight miss to prompt a sell-off. As a result, the stock was down 5.1% as of 12:55 p.m. ET.ServiceNow posts a solid first quarterRevenue in the quarter rose 24% to $2.6 billion, which essentially matched estimates at $2.59 billion. Subscription revenue rose 25% to $2.5 billion, and current remaining performance obligations, a reflection of the work that's booked for the next year, were up 21% to $8.45 billion, showing demand remains solid.<img alt=""A group of IT workers in a server room."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/upaEqnkFgu7naN7ozsdrkg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/6b12a493a3f2bf8f7b54426ce01a02b0 class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.ServiceNow also booked eight transactions of more than $5 million in annual contract value, doubling from the quarter a year ago. This shows it was attracting more large contracts and large customers.Operating margin was up solidly in the quarter as ServiceNow gained leverage in every line item on its income statement. It reported an adjusted operating margin of 30%, up from 26% in the quarter a year ago. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share jumped from $2.37 to $3.41, which beat estimates of $3.14.CEO Bill McDermott said the company was off to a fast start in 2024, adding, ""As leaders seek significant productivity improvements, ServiceNow has first-mover advantages with years of investment in AI technology and talent.""Why ServiceNow stock fellThe company's guidance for the second quarter was decent, calling for subscription revenue growth of 21.5%-22% to $2.525-$2.53 billion, which represented a sequential deceleration from the first quarter and was better than the consensus at $2.45 billion. However, for the full year, the company called for $10.56 billion-$10.57 billion in subscription revenue, up 21.5%-22%, but below the consensus of $10.59 billionIn an environment where investors are beginning to question tech stock valuations, that seemed to be enough to prompt the sell-off.

            +4.64% ","Shares of coffee and carbonated beverage giant Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP) popped on Thursday after the company reported soaring profits in its latest quarterly financial report. As of 2:40 p.m. ET, Keurig Dr Pepper stock was up 4% but it had been up almost 7% earlier in the day.Profits are up more than salesKeurig Dr Pepper mostly sells coffeemakers, coffee brewing supplies, and packaged beverages. In the first quarter of 2024, the company's net sales were only up by a modest 3% to $3.5 billion. However, it enjoyed substantial improvements to profits, which is what investors are cheering today.Keurig Dr Pepper's gross margin expanded to nearly 56% compared with 52% in the prior-year period. Productivity improvements were partially credited for the increase. And on an adjusted basis, the company's Q1 operating income jumped 17.5% to $825 million.For the year, Keurig Dr Pepper continues to anticipate modest top-line growth. But it hopes its adjusted profits will grow close to 10%. And this profit growth has the stock up today.How is management using profits?Keurig Dr Pepper's management credited itself with buying back more stock than ever during Q1 -- it used $1.1 billion during Q1 alone, which was a record. Management said it was being opportunistic with the stock's valuation. But that's only half the story.The other half is that JAB Holding Company owns a lot of Keurig Dr Pepper stock. And in March, it announced it was divesting 100 million shares. Management, therefore, was buying up these shares to prevent downward pressure on the stock.Granted, Keurig Dr Pepper did get a good deal on these shares at under $30 per share. But JAB has more to sell. Fortunately this doesn't dilute shareholders. But this stock may have more sellers than buyers for a little while as JAB sells.The good news is that Keurig Dr Pepper's profits are ahead of schedule and management is using some to increase its marketing. That might further bolster some sales growth, which would be good for investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Keurig Dr Pepper right now?Before you buy stock in Keurig Dr Pepper, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Keurig Dr Pepper wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pam-sets-dutch-auction-buy-185821674.html,Pam sets Dutch auction to buy back shares; battered stock price soars,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 2:58 PM EDT","PTSI
            +17.95% ","Pam is buying back about 2.5% of its stock via a Dutch auction. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Pam Transportation, the auto industry-focused truckload carrier whose stock has been battered in the past year and beyond, is buying back some of its shares through a process known as a Dutch auction.Companies buy back their stock frequently but generally do so in a lower-key manner, entering the market as an occasional or frequent buyer operating through the normal processes of the equity markets. Companies often declare their intention to buy back stock over a certain period, but the specifics of those purchases are far less transparent and open-ended than in a Dutch auction.By contrast, Pam (NASDAQ: PTSI) announced the Dutch auction in a press release and in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Wednesday.If one of the goals of the Dutch auction was to boost the company’s stock price, it was working Thursday. At approximately 1:30 p.m., Pam stock was up $2.97, a gain of 20.43%, to $17.51.Pam’s stock set its 52-week high on June 7, 2023, when it reached $28.77. Its 52-week low was $13.51 on Monday, a decline of 53% since the 52-week high.The stock decline has been more dramatic since its high-water mark of near $40 in November 2022. The percentage decline from the peak to the recent 52-week low is roughly two-thirds.Pam has not paid a dividend since a special one-time payout in 2012.Pam executives are prohibited from discussing the offer while it is in what is known as “quiet time” before an action governed by SEC rules.However, the goals of the auction were set forth in a company filing with the SEC.“Our Board of Directors has determined that the Offer is a prudent use of our financial resources and presents an appropriate balance between meeting the needs of our business and delivering value to our stockholders,” the document said. “Our Board of Directors determined that a cash tender offer is an appropriate mechanism to return capital to stockholders that seek liquidity under current market conditions while, at the same time, allowing other stockholders to share in a higher portion of our future potential.”The auction “provides stockholders (particularly those who, because of the size of their shareholdings, might not be able to sell their shares without potential disruption to the share price) with an opportunity to obtain liquidity with respect to all or a portion of their shares, without potential disruption to the share price and the usual transaction costs associated with market sales.”One shareholder who fits the bill of not being able to sell without “potential disruption to the share price” is Pam Chairman Matthew Moroun and the trusts his family controls. Those individuals and trusts own more than 50% of the company, according to Pam’s 10-K filing with the SEC in March.Story continuesThe SEC filings note that management participation in the Dutch auction is permitted.But even shareholders who get shut out or choose to sit out the auction will benefit, Pam’s filing said. “If we complete the offer, stockholders who do not participate in the offer will automatically increase their relative percentage ownership interest in us and our future operations at no additional cost to them,” the company said.In a Dutch auction, shareholders are invited to offer their shares at a designated price. Pam has set the range for bids it will accept as $15.50 to $18. All of the bids are in increments of 50 cents.<img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kTnlrOaNxMe0J64ABPi56Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ0MjtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/freightwaves_373/928c3b898df5841fa26e7676cf588f56 class=caas-img>What the Dutch auction offer looks likePam then would review the bids and accept up to 550,000 shares at the lowest price it can select to fulfill its goal of buying that quantity. The quantity is about 2.5% of the number of outstanding Pam shares.Under Dutch auction procedures, the company can choose to accept fewer than 550,000 shares. Pam also can buy shares in excess of 550,000.The offer is open until May 22.Master Class, the online education offering, laid out in one of its presentations the pros and cons of a Dutch auction. Its benefits: It is faster than a traditional auction (and the normal process for buying and selling shares is a type of auction); it might benefit a company like Pam because the shareholders looking to sell their shares “don’t know what prices the other bidders are willing to pay. This uncertainty can make them more willing to pay a higher price to make a successful bid and quickly achieve closure”; and the process can “help determine the best asking price.” For that reason, Dutch auctions are often used to sell shares in an IPO rather than having the underwriters set the price.Pam’s fortunes have long been tied to the fate of the automotive industry. In its 10-K filing with the SEC for this year, Pam said its top five customers, based on revenue, accounted for about 34% of its revenue. General Motors accounted for about 12%.Few analysts cover Pam stock. But CFRA, an independent research firm, has a buy rating on the company’s stock.Pam had a tough first quarter. Its revenue net of fuel was $161 million, down from $193.4 million a year earlier. The company was barely profitable, with net earnings of 1 cent per share, but posted an operating loss. A year ago, net income was 23 cents.More articles by John KingstonPam Transport buys New York carrier Metropolitan for $77.4 million in its first acquisition in 19 yearsPam, flying high on Wall Street, sets $1 billion target for 20255 auto haulers combining to create publicly traded trucking companyThe post Pam sets Dutch auction to buy back shares; battered stock price soars appeared first on FreightWaves.View comments"

            -0.46% ","Shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) gained ground on Thursday, climbing as much as 1.1%. While this might not seem like much to celebrate, the gains came against the backdrop of a broader market downturn as the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8% and the S&P 500 shed 0.6% (as of this writing). As of 1:41 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 0.5%.The catalyst that sent the memory and storage chipmaker higher was word that the company would receive as much as $13 billion in loans and subsidies from the CHIPS Act.An influx of cashThe White House announced on Thursday that Micron would receive grants and loans under the CHIPS and Science Act, a program designed to revitalize the semiconductor industry in the U.S. Micron, a leading supplier of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, will receive up to $6.1 billion in federal grants to subsidize the construction of two fabrication facilities -- one in Clay, New York, and the other in Boise, Idaho, where Micron is headquartered. In addition to the direct funding, the preliminary agreement also provides $7.5 billion in loans to support these projects.In return for these funds, Micron has agreed to invest up to $125 billion between the two states over the next two decades to ""build a leading-edge memory manufacturing ecosystem.""In addition to the funds from the CHIPS Act, Micron will benefit from the investment tax credit, which provides a credit of 25% for ""qualified capital investments."" The state of New York is also offering $5.5 billion in incentives over the life of the project.Micron becomes the fourth chipmaker to receive funds under the program, which has also disbursed $8.5 billion in funds to Intel, $6.6 billion to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and $6.4 billion to Samsung.This represents a strategic opportunity for Micron, yet the stock is selling for less than 4x next year's sales.

            -10.13% ","Shares of global consumer appliance company Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR) sank to 52-week lows on Thursday after the company reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024. As of 1:30 p.m. ET, Whirlpool stock was down almost 12%.Investors don't like Whirlpool's strugglesWhirlpool is facing multiple headwinds. First, the company has a lot of debt. Second, inflation has increased its cost of manufacturing. And third, home-appliance purchases have slowed due to a slow housing market, meaning that management has to lower prices to stimulate sales. This is a bad combination.Whirlpool's Q1 net sales were down everywhere except for Latin America, resulting in a 3% year-over-year drop to $4.5 billion. The company also had ongoing earnings per share (EPS) of $1.78, which were down 33%, reflecting the higher costs coupled with lower-than-ideal selling prices.To reduce costs, Whirlpool is laying off 1,000 workers, according to The Wall Street Journal. This will reportedly save it $400 million eventually. But investors don't necessarily like layoffs because it's a reminder that the business is struggling. This was also likely on investors' minds today as they gave up on Whirlpool stock.Hope on the horizon?I pointed out ongoing EPS above instead of plain ol' EPS because it is significant in this case. After Q1 ended, Whirlpool completed the sale of its business in Europe. There were one-time expenses with this deal that are impacting numbers this year. But the move is expected to boost free cash flow long term.Whirlpool hopes that it can generate around $1.2 billion in free cash flow in 2026 and beyond as a result of the moves it's making today.

            +2.93% ","Merck Stock Gains On Its Blockbuster Cancer Drug Keytruda, Raises Annual Outlook

On Thursday, U.S. drug maker Merck & Co Inc (NYSE:MRK) reported first-quarter sales of $15.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year, beating the consensus estimate of $15.2 billion.

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 24%.

Merck reported adjusted EPS of $2.07, up 48%Y/Y, beating the consensus of $1.88.

Merck’s pharmaceutical unit booked $14.01 billion in revenue during the first quarter, up 10% Y/Y.

Merck’s blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda largely drove the growth. Keytruda generated $6.95 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 20% from the year-earlier period.

Merck has become dependent on Keytruda for more than 40% of company sales and faces a revenue hit when Keytruda’s main U.S. patent expires in 2028.

Merck also reported a 14% jump in sales of Gardasil to $2.25 billion, a vaccine that prevents cancer from HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.

Merck’s Januvia drew $670 million in sales, down 24%, primarily due to lower drug pricing, falling demand in the U.S., and generic competition in several international markets.

Januvia is one of 10 drugs targeted in ongoing Medicare drug price negotiations.

Guidance: Merck raised and narrowed its full-year 2024 revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts.

The company now expects 2024 sales of $63.1 billion-$64.3 billion, up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion compared to the consensus of $63.82 billion.

The company expects 2024 adjusted EPS of $8.53-$8.65, compared to prior guidance of $8.44-$8.59 and the consensus of $8.56.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck’s acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Price Action: MRK shares are up 2.26% at $129.88 at the last check Thursday.

            +28.65% ","Shares of Impinj (NASDAQ: PI) skyrocketed on Thursday. On the heels of an impressive earnings report, the stock traded 27.9% higher at 1:25 p.m. ET, reaching a fresh all-time high.Impinj's Q1 by the numbersYour average Wall Street analyst expected Impinj to report adjusted earnings near $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter, based on top-line revenue around $73.6 million. Instead, the maker of radio frequency ID (RFID) asset-tracking tags and related systems delivered $0.21 of earnings per share on $76.8 million in sales.Impinj's management set second-quarter guidance targets far ahead of the Street's current consensus projections. The analyst view points to next-quarter earnings of roughly $0.19 per share and sales in the neighborhood of $79 million. The midpoint of the company's official target ranges stop at $0.75 per share and $97 million, respectively.CEO Chris Diorio highlighted strong RFID tag sales in the apparel and general merchandise portions of the retail sector.""We see continued strength looking into the second quarter,"" Diorio said on the earnings call. ""Looking further out, we see growing opportunities to drive recurring licensing and services revenue, monetizing our [intellectual property] platform and cloud services.""Measuring the retail market's recovery with RFID tagsDiorio expects the first-quarter strength to translate into a broad surge in RFID demand. In other words, this earnings surprise could be the start of a sustained growth spurt, rather than a unique single-quarter boost.In turn, robust Impinj results should point to healthier business trends in the retail sector as a whole. Two large customers are accelerating their RFID-tracking installations. Of course, nobody knows exactly what the global economy will look like by the holidays or in 2025, but large retailers are willing to bet big money on an upturn in the foreseeable future.Should you invest $1,000 in Impinj right now?Before you buy stock in Impinj, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Impinj wasn’t one of them.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Mark. S&P Global is off to a tremendous start for 2024. Total revenue increased 14%, excluding the divestiture of engineering solutions. Transaction revenue in our Ratings Division drove much of the upside, but importantly, subscription revenue across the entire company increased 8% year over year as well.Strong growth across the enterprise contributed to quarterly revenue of nearly $3.5 billion, representing the highest quarterly revenue we've ever generated in the history of our company. Execution was a theme in the first quarter, and our efforts to capture market opportunities, combined with discipline on the expense side, led to more than 350 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year over year, and adjusted EPS growth of 27%. In addition to the stellar financial results in the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate our leadership across global markets. Capital markets were vibrant in the first quarter, and customers turned to S&P Global to help power their investment, funding, and trading activities.Equity markets saw strong volumes from both IPOs and M&A, and we saw the highest level of debt issuance since 2021. As the globe grapples with the future of energy security and energy transition, it's no coincidence that this conversation took place on the stage of S&P Global's CERAWeek Conference and other S&P events around the world. As we power global markets in equity, fixed income, commodities, derivatives, and in many industrial verticals, our innovation drives customer value. We'll continue to innovate and invest in our leading data technology and workflow tools to drive growth.And we'll highlight some of that innovation today. As we look to the five strategic pillars we outlined for you in our investor day, we're pleased with the progress we've made across the board. While that fifth pillar of execute and deliver is on full display this quarter with the strength of our financial results, we continue to invest in customer relationships, innovation, technology, and our people. Beginning with our customers, we saw nearly $1 trillion of billed issuance in the first quarter.This represents the dollar value of debt issued by our customers, for which they actively sought out a rating from S&P Global. Issuers know that an S&P Global rating provides a credible, trusted, and objective measure of their credit risk. And they know that we have the capacity, even in a very active market, to fully meet their needs. When we look at the broader financial services landscape, we're certainly not back to what we would consider normal levels in the capital markets overall, but we did see improvement.With the macro and geopolitical uncertainties still facing our customers through this year, we continue to hear some concern about the back half, and many market participants are still carefully evaluating expenses for 2024. All of this is consistent with what we shared in February regarding our expectation that ratings would see a stronger first half than second half, while market intelligence would likely start to see improvements in the growth rates in the back half. Energy customers from all of our divisions and from around the globe converged once again in Houston, Texas for our Annual CERAWeek Conference. We're thrilled that customers, partners, regulators, government officials, and global thought leaders view S&P Global CERAWeek as the premier event of the year.Customer engagement remains vital for S&P Global, and in the first quarter, we had well over 100,000 calls and meetings with customers, in addition to the thousands of meaningful interactions our ratings colleagues had with fixed income investors. Build issuance increased 45% year over year in the first quarter. Tight spreads and stabilizing risk appetite in the market created favorable conditions for issuers. We saw investment grade, high yield, and bank loan volumes all increase as issuers took full advantage to raise debt early in the year.We do expect much of this strength was pulled forward from later in 2024, reinforcing our continued view of a stronger first half than second half in issuance volumes. The strength in build issuance in the quarter also underscored the importance and advantages of a robust public debt market. We saw tremendous growth over the last two years in private debt markets, but we began to see early signs of some of that debt being refinanced in the public markets in the first quarter. While this private to public refinancing activity only represented a low single digit percent of build issuance, we've heard from customers that they're saving up to 150 to 200 basis points in their interest rates by refinancing the public markets.We expect the private markets to play an important role going forward as well. We're working with major private debt partners to deliver risk analytical solutions. Private markets revenue in our ratings division increased 30% year over year in the first quarter. Turning to Vitality.We're pleased to see that our Vitality Index continues to account for 10% of our total revenue, despite the fact that several strong and fast growing products matured out of Vitality Index at the end of 2023. As we've called out in the past, this index is meant to highlight the contributions from new or enhanced products. So as products mature, they will no longer be part of the Vitality Index, even if they continue to grow rapidly. Key contributors from our pricing, valuations and reference data, as well as several thematic and factor-based indices matured out of the Vitality Index at the end of the year.We remain committed to that 10% target as a steady stream of new innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. That was the case this quarter as products that contributed roughly $80 million of revenue to the Vitality Index in the first quarter of 2023 were no longer in the Vitality Index this quarter. We expect the Vitality Index to increase as a percent of total revenue as we progress through the remainder of the year. Turning to some examples of that innovation.In the first quarter, our commodity insights team launched a new food and agriculture commodities dashboard, providing a comprehensive view on commodity data, as well as new reports and research on energy. Additionally, we launched new price assessments for renewable energy, as well as new benchmark prices for the Middle East and Asia. Our energy transition and climate products continue to show rapid growth, nearly 30% year over year in the first quarter, supported by the continued innovation and price assessments, new and enhanced datasets and crucial insight solutions. We also introduced an exciting innovation in market intelligence.We've spoken at length about the tools and datasets available through our market intelligence marketplace. But in the first quarter, we introduced what we are calling blueprints. These blueprints are packages of datasets and tools combined based on specific customer personas and workflows, such as private markets performance analytics. We introduced the first five blueprints in the first quarter, with plans to add more in the coming months.These intuitive combinations allow customers to easily discover how our data and tools can work together to facilitate analytics and workflows in new ways. We're also pleased to see early results from the enterprise AI initiatives we outlined for you last quarter. By elevating artificial intelligence to a position of enterprise wide strategic focus, we're accelerating the development of new tools, deploying common capabilities across multiple divisions and increasing the value we create for our customers and our shareholders. With our in-house expertise, we've developed tools to help market participants benchmark performance of large language models, specifically for business and finance use cases.The S&P AI Benchmarks by Kensho is a project informed by our world-class data and industry expertise. The questions in our benchmark are designed to assess the ability of large language models to understand and solve realistic finance problems, and each question has been verified by an experienced domain expert. Lastly, we introduced a remarkable tool we call S&P SPARK Assist. This is a co-pilot platform developed jointly between Kensho and our other internal technology teams.We're deploying this platform throughout the organization to improve productivity, facilitate more rapid innovation and reduce the time necessary to accomplish many routine tasks. Because of our proprietary data, the tools and expertise developed through Kensho and the remarkable technologists we have working throughout S&P Global, we were able to develop S&P SPARK Assist chat interface without relying on a third party vendor. As a result, we're delivering the power of generative AI to our people in an easy to use platform at the cost of less than $1 per user per month. We're incredibly excited about what this tool can do for our people, and we'll provide more details around use cases and productivity as we progress through the year.Turning to our financial results, Chris will walk through the first quarter results in more detail in a moment, but we have had an incredible start to 2024. With strong growth across every division, we continue to balance the need to invest for future growth with the opportunity to deliver margin expansion and earnings growth this year. Revenue grew double digits as reported, but excluding the impact from the engineering solutions divestiture, revenue increased an impressive 14%. Trailing 12 month margins improved 170 basis points to nearly 47%.Now, we'll turn to Chris Craig, our interim CFO to review the financial results. Chris, welcome to the call, over to you.Chris Craig -- Interim Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Doug. 2024 got off to a strong start as we saw three of five divisions achieve double digit growth. As Doug mentioned, reported revenue grew 10% in the first quarter, and excluding the impact of the engineering solutions divestiture, revenue growth was 14%. Adjusted expenses grew by only 3% year over year as we continue to focus on disciplined execution and benefiting from the engineering solutions divestiture.Strong growth and solid execution combined to deliver more than 350 basis points of adjusted margin expansion in the quarter. With our commitment to capital returns over the last 12 months, we've reduced the fully diluted share count by 3% year over year. This led to adjusted earnings per share increasing by 27% year over year to $4.01. Now, turning to strategic investment areas.Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 15% to $78 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand for commodity insights energy transition products and benchmark offerings, as well as EV transition related consulting in mobility. We are continuing to invest in our energy transition offerings where we see opportunities across our divisions. Moving to private market solutions, revenue increased by 16% year over year to $116 million. Growth was driven by debt and bank loan ratings, as well as continued strength in I-level and other private market solutions within market intelligence.We continue to build momentum in our revenue synergies and are ahead of schedule toward our $350 million target. We exited the first quarter with an annualized run rate of $184 million. During the first quarter alone, we recognized $56 million in revenue synergies. While the majority of this was from cross-sell initiatives, we are beginning to gain traction with new products as well.As of the end of Q1, we have launched 25 new products through our revenue synergy initiatives, and we plan to launch more than 15 additional synergy products by the end of 2024. Turning to our divisions, market intelligence revenue increased 7% in the first quarter, with all business lines growing in the mid-to-high single digit range. Desktop grew 5% as we continued to focus on speed, performance improvements, and the introduction of new content and capabilities, including the expansion of our collection of premium broker research providers with in after market research. Data advisory solutions grew 7% driven by expanded coverage and continued investment in high growth areas of our company information and analytics, and market data and valuation product offerings.Enterprise solutions benefited from an increase in issuance volumes in the debt and equity capital markets and grew over 8% in the quarter. Credit and risk solutions grew 6%, supported by strong new sales and price realization, particularly for Ratings Express Subscriptions. We saw solid growth in market intelligence in Q1, that was in line with our expectations and consistent with what we signaled on our fourth quarter earnings call. Adjusted expenses increased 6% year over year, primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, cloud costs, and royalties, partially offset by reduction in outside services expense.Operating profit increased 9% and the operating margin increased 70 basis points to 32.7%. Trailing 12-month margins expanded 50 basis points to 33.1%. Now, turning to ratings. As Doug mentioned earlier, we saw issuers take advantage of favorable financing conditions, which led to strong refinancing and opportunistic issuance in the first quarter.Ratings revenue increased 29% year over year, exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew by 54% in the first quarter, as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high yield issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 8%, primarily due to an increase in annual fee revenue and strong demand for our rating and valuation service and issuer credit rating products. Adjusted expenses increased 9%, driven by higher compensation, including incentives, as well as increased T&E expense, as our commercial and analytical teams were actively meeting with issuers to help drive the strong growth we saw in the quarter.This resulted in a 43% increase in operating profit and a 640 basis point increase in operating margin to 64.7%. For the trailing 12 months, Ratings margins expanded 290 basis points to 58.5%. And now, turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 10% following the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy and Resources Data and Insights.Price Assessments and Energy and Resources Data and Insights grew 14% and 12% respectively. We continue to see commercial momentum across both business lines, as our established benchmark data and insights products have driven customer conversations about our emerging offerings. Advisory and Transactional services revenue grew 10%, driven by strong trading volumes across key sectors in Global Trading Services and an excellent turnout at our Premier Global Energy Conference, CERAWeek. Upstream data and insights revenue grew by 2% year over year, benefiting from demand for our carbon emissions monitoring offerings, as well as improvement in retention rate.The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base. Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to higher compensation costs and ongoing investment in growth initiative. Operating profit for commodity insights increased 13% and operating margin improved by 110 basis points to 47.2%. The trailing 12-month margin increased by 120 basis points to 46.4%.Now, turning to mobility, revenue increased 8% year over year. The dealer segment marked its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and we also saw solid performance from our financials and other business lines. Dealer revenue increased 12% year over year, driven by new business growth in products such as new car listings and CARFAX for Life, as well as the addition of market scan. Manufacturing declined by 3%, driven by a decrease in one-time transactional revenue, particularly in our recall and marketing businesses, which was partially offset by growth in subscription sales.It's important to understand that revenue from Recall products will fluctuate based on the level of activity in any given period. Financials and other increased 12% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases. Adjusted expenses increased 10% due to both planned investments and strategic growth initiatives and the full quarter impact of the Market Scan acquisition. While this resulted in 100 basis points of margin contraction to 38.1% for the quarter and a 70 basis point reduction to 38.6% for the trailing 12 months, operating profit for mobility increased by 5% year over year.Now, turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, revenue increased 14% primarily due to strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM and continued strength in Exchange Traded derivative revenue. Revenue associated with asset-linked fees was up an impressive 16% in the first quarter. This was driven by higher ETF and mutual fund AUM benefiting from both market appreciation and net inflows. We also saw an increase in revenue for OTC products.Exchange Traded derivatives revenue grew 12%, primarily driven by strong volumes in SPX products and price realization. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6% year over year driven by new business growth in end-of-day contracts. Expenses increased 9% year over year primarily due to increased investments in strategic growth initiatives, as well as an increase in compensation expense. Indices operating profit increased 15% and operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 72.9%.On a trailing 12-month basis, margins expanded by 30 basis points to 69.3%. In the aggregate, our businesses demonstrated exceptional revenue and margin growth while at the same time permitting us to invest in our strategic growth initiatives during the quarter, giving us a strong start to 2024. And with that, I will now turn it back to Doug to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Doug?Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Chris. We've updated our outlook reflecting our economist view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024, as well as the outperformance against our internal estimates during the first quarter. Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 3.2%, U.S. inflation of 2.8%, and an average price for Brent crude of $85 per barrel.All three of these figures are slightly higher than we originally assumed in our outlook in February. Additionally, our original macroeconomic view included the base case assumption for three rate cuts by the U.S. Fed, beginning no earlier than June. As we've seen over the last three months, market expectations around interest rates have shifted.And while our economists have not formally updated the number of rate cuts in their base case scenario, our financial guidance now assumes fewer than three rate cuts in 2024. We're increasing our billed issuance forecast for 2024 by approximately three percentage points, to a range of 6% to 10%. As we noted last quarter, our initial outlook for 2024 assumed a stronger first half of the year for issuance. Even with that assumption, the first quarter outperformed our expectations, though we believe much of that outperformance is pull forward as issuers look to take advantage of very favorable market conditions.All of these factors impact our new full year guidance calling for higher growth and stronger margins. This slide illustrates our current guidance or GAAP results. For our adjusted guidance, we're now expecting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, reflecting the outperformance in Ratings and Indices in the first quarter, partially offset by slightly softer expectations for issuance in the second half of the year. Excluding the impact of 2023 divestitures, we expect revenue growth to be slightly more than 1 percentage point higher than reported revenue growth.We also now expect to deliver stronger margins in 2024 with margin expansion in the range of 100 to 150 basis points compared to our prior guidance of approximately 100 basis points. We're taking a balanced approach to reinvesting for future growth while still expanding margins and remain on track to achieve the investor day targets from 2022. We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.85 to $14.10, which represents 11% growth at the midpoint. This represents a $0.10 increase from our prior range driven by the increased revenue and profitability outlook for the year.We're also increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, by $100 million despite modestly higher expected capex. Higher expected net income and disciplined management of working capital both contribute to the higher expected cash flow for the year. Moving to our division outlook. We're reiterating our revenue growth expectations for Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and Mobility.And we're increasing the growth outlook for Ratings and Indices based on the strength in the first quarter. We're also raising the margin outlook for Indices to reflect the very strong performance year-to-date. While margins were also very strong in our Ratings division in the first quarter, we're reiterating the range for full year margins, which implies approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint. Since much of the revenue outperformance in Q1 likely came from pull forward, our full year guidance assumes year over year declines in Ratings transaction revenue in the fourth quarter as we begin to lap much stronger comps from last year.As a result, we expect margins to be softer in the back half of the year than in the first half in Ratings. With that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, president of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, president of S&P Global Ratings and executive lead for Sustainable1 to join us. I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Thank you.Mark Grant -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsThank you, Doug. [Operator instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.Questions & Answers:OperatorOur first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.Toni Kaplan -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThank you so much. I wanted to focus on Market Intelligence. We've heard some negative commentary from others in the market, which made it sound like this past quarter was particularly challenging. So I wanted to see if that was your experience as well? And also if the large investment bank consolidation impact was in this quarter or if it hasn't hit yet.And then, I know you're talking about Market Intelligence being better in the back half. And so, wanted to just flesh out what gives you the confidence that that happens.Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market IntelligenceToni, it's Adam. Thank you for the question. So yes, we're seeing many of the things that others are seeing in our markets, particularly for our financial services customers. We're seeing that particularly in the smallest of those customers, and that's probably comparable to what some others are seeing.But for us, that's really where the concentrations are. The specific consolidation that you're talking about in terms of the overall scale of our division, it's not something that impacts us in a material way. That -- some of that has already been absorbed. Some will continue to come.But all of that has been anticipated by us in the guidance and the view that we've given you forward. We do view what's going on in the market today is very much a cyclical headwind. But the secular tailwinds that we see in our businesses, particularly in our core areas of focus like private markets, the expansion of our Desktop, you see some of the improvements in the investment we've made over the last two years. That gives us a lot of confidence in achieving our long-term goals and the continued growth of the business, confidence in what we've explained we expect to do for the current year and in delivering against the longer-range investor day targets that we set out in 2022.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Toni.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.Manav Patnaik -- Barclays -- AnalystThank you. I just wanted to ask on Market Intelligence as well. Just in terms of the strategy going forward, obviously, tough budget environment. Competitors are probably sharpening their pencils too.Just can you help us with the strategy there? And also kind of tied to that is the -- when does Visible Alpha close? How should we think about the contribution and also the divestiture that you were planning? Like what else is in there?Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market IntelligenceOK. Thanks, Manav, and thank you for the question. Let me just start with the last piece, Visible Alpha. We do expect that transaction to close here in the second quarter.We're quite excited about it. I think it's an important part of one of our strategic areas, which is the continued expansion and improvement in quality of the Cap IQ Pro set of solutions that we offer to the market. As we highlighted, I think really as far back as investor day, we have a few core areas of focus that we do think we'll continue to grow. And that really shapes our strategic focus.Those are in areas like private markets, sustainability of the supply chain, the expansion of our Desktop, the ability to deliver our data and solutions to customer in as easy a way as possible. These are things that our largest customers are looking for as they go through consolidations of vendors. That's where the scale and breadth of services that we're able to offer through Market Intelligence and of course, across the broader S&P Global enterprise really has impact. We'll be laser-focused on that strategy.And as you've seen when we announced at our last call, we'll look at those businesses where we see underperformance or lack of strategic fit, and we'll make decisions on those. And where we see opportunities to acquire unique assets that are high growth or have particular proprietary value companies like Visible Alpha, the one you mentioned, quite excited to get that integrated. We're going to take advantage of our position and our opportunity to bring them into the business. So thanks again, Manav.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Manav.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open.Heather Balsky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi. Thank you for taking my question. I'd love to hear more about how -- you talked about a pull forward in issuance into the first quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about, on a regular basis, how much visibility do you have as you look three quarters out? And how do you think about taking some level of conservatism, given we're in an election year, there's an uncertain rate environment.Just how are you positioning yourself with regards to the guidance, given what you saw in the first quarter? Thanks.Martina Cheung -- President, S&P Global RatingsHeather, it's Martina. Thanks very much for the question. So we look at a variety of factors to give us a good sense for the issuance pipeline in the immediate time frame. Typically, we would look at 180-day pipelines, for example, as well as more near term, but also throughout as much as we can, next nine to 12 months.Those factors, macro factors, GDP inflation rates, geopolitical factors, which, of course, is something we're paying very close attention to this year. But we also look, as we've mentioned in the past, obviously, at maturity walls, the pace of refinancing, as well as growth and investor interest in different asset classes such as private markets, sustainable finance, structured finance, infrastructure, etc. So the -- those factors give us a very good sense at any point in time for where we are with respect to the year. If you look at what we saw in Q1 of this year in terms of billed issuance, we saw a very high volume of refinancing of maturity walls in high-yield and bank loan.About two thirds overall the issuance activity that we saw was related to refinancing. That was a combination of heavy refinancing at '24, but we also saw some '25 and '26 refinancing quarter as well. So that's really the key area of outperformance from an issuance standpoint in Q1. And we would expect that activity to continue in bank loan and high yield through the second quarter and then taper off a little bit, largely because we've been hearing consistently even since before our last call that high yield and bank loan issuers, as well as, to some extent, investment-grade issuers are wanting to really get ahead of any volatility you see in the back half of the year and take advantage of the relative market stability and favorable spreads that we're seeing at this time.Now, in investment grade, a very strong quarter, but we think a lot of that investment-grade issuance is pulled forward in the second half of the year. There were a handful of several large M&A deals there as well but not enough volume for us to really change our view for investment-grade issuance for the rest of the year. So I hope that helps. And happy to take any more questions on issuance.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Heather.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Faiza Alwy -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystYes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much.Wanted to follow up on the Ratings and maybe more on the margin front. So while you're increasing the revenue outlook, margins -- you haven't increased margins. So I'm curious if it's mix of business or any investment sort of how we should think about the margin performance through the rest of the year?Martina Cheung -- President, S&P Global RatingsThanks for the question. Well, as you know, we've said numerous times in the past, we're solving for long-term sustainable margin in the Ratings business. And we are a very disciplined steward of capital in the business. So our guidance for the year, which we reiterated at 57.5 to 58.5, as Doug said in his remarks, at the midpoint represents about 150 basis points of margin expansion year over year.We can do a lot with the base that we have. So the reason why I say that is because we have this incredible blockbuster quarter from an issuance standpoint without having to add tremendous amounts of additional staff to meet that need. And that is really, I think, reinforcement of the capacity preservation strategy that we initiated a couple of years ago. So we're very pleased with how we're operating from an expense management, capacity management standpoint and very comfortable with the margin range that we have right now as we -- as it relates to the full year.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Faiza.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.Andrew Steinerman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- AnalystHi, Martina, it's Andrew. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about issuance pull forward. Just you're talking so much about it intra-year kind of second half pull forward to first half. Just broadly, aren't we still in the midst of a pretty large issuance recovery after the big declines of '22?Martina Cheung -- President, S&P Global RatingsAndrew, thanks very much for the question. I would say a couple of things. So the context on a lot of my commentary on intra-year I would say I'd lean more on the investment-grade side, where we think we saw a 2H pull forward. I think we did see pull forward of '25 and '26 maturities, for example, on the refinancing front for high yield and bank loans.So a little bit of a mix there between the spec-grade asset class and investment-grade asset class. I think to your broader point, yes, we are and continue to be in midst of recovery, notwithstanding the very steep growth rates, for example, in high yield and investment grade. We're still not seeing the issuance volumes back to anything close to what we might have characterized as market highs for example, in the past, or even market averages that we might have seen in the past. So there's still room to go here throughout the next several years.This is something that we've commented on since '22, believing that it was going to take some years to come back to it. But of course, the maturity walls themselves are quite a large factor here. And on the spec-grade asset classes, high-yield and BLR, jointly, we've got about $1.1 trillion in maturities still outstanding for us in '25 and '26. So we're monitoring very, very closely and tightly the indicators that would give us a sense for the pace and timing of those maturities.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Andrew.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.Alex Kramm -- UBS -- AnalystYes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just another one on the margin actually, but more on the outlook for the full company and nice to see the margin outlook being raised.But just wondering, is this just a business mix driven upside? Or is there anything else going on, and I'm asking particularly since you mentioned execution in your prepared remarks. So just wondering, is this just execution on the sales and revenue side or following last year's, I guess, disappointments a couple of times, if you take a little bit of a harder look at the cost base and where you can be more efficient.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Alex. Well, as you know, we run the company with an approach to budgeting and management, where we always start the year with a positive jaw. That's just our philosophy. We look and see how we're going to do in our core businesses.We go out to see our customers. We understand what we can build as a forward-looking pipeline, forward-looking expectations for the market. We then ourselves say, what would be the expense level that we want to have to support that growth. On top of that, we then come back and say, how much can we afford to invest.As you saw in this quarter, our expenses grew 3%. That's a result of very, very strong execution coming out of 2023. We're ensuring that we can have very clear tracking of all of our expenses. It's just part of our philosophy of how we run the company.Going forward for the rest of the year, you see that we're going to continue that approach. But we think that this is part of the way we manage the company. We're always looking at being very tight on understanding our revenue sources and then moving forward to have a tight approach to our expenses. Thanks, Alex.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.Ashish Sabadra -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThanks for taking my question. I just wanted to drill down further on Market Intelligence, both the recurring variable and the subscription growth. We've seen some really strong 13% growth in recurring variable last two quarters. How should we think about those tailwinds there? And is that mostly contributed from IP and WSO going forward? And then, on the subscription side, the 6% growth, that moderated a bit.But how should we think about those momentum as we get -- go through the year?Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market IntelligenceThanks, Ashish, for the question. So we watch our recurring revenue growth very carefully in this quarter, more than 7% growth in our recurring revenue. Some of that comes from volumes in our businesses that are affected by capital markets volumes. Over the years, we've sought to actually temper that a bit using more fixed contracts.Our customers in most of those markets prefer it. And for us, it adds a little bit more stability and regular growth to the business. Quarter to quarter, we'll see some variation in those numbers, but we do expect our recurring revenue, our subscription revenue to continue to grow in line with our full year guidance for the division. Thanks again.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Ashish.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.Jeff Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you so much. I just wanted to continue with the Ratings question. I think you said that billed issuance was up 45% year over year in the quarter, but Ratings revenue was only up 29%. I know in prior quarters, they've been much tighter in terms of the correlation.Can you explain what happened this quarter, why the difference?Martina Cheung -- President, S&P Global RatingsJeff, it's Martina. Thanks for the question. So to your point, billed issuance was up 54 -- sorry, 45%. But transaction revenue, which is the revenue portion or revenue category that is most closely correlated to billed issuance was up 54%.So we grew faster than billed issuance in the quarter. Overall revenue growth of 29% represented both the transaction revenue growth of 54 and the non-transaction revenue growth of 8%. So really just the evening out of the performance across those to get to the 29% growth. Perhaps I will just comment briefly on the non-transaction growth drivers.We were quite pleased with the performance in the quarter. We had continued strength in RES with a lot of companies looking for scenarios around their capital stacks. We saw some new ICR issuance in the quarter and had strong performance on the surveillance book and fee programs. Thanks for the question.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Jeff.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.Scott Wurtzel -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask just on the revenue synergies here. I mean, it looks like it was a pretty strong quarter, recognizing $56 million and then the run rate being pretty impressive here.And in the context of you guys talking about recognizing 45% of synergies in 2024, wondering how we should think about that number now that we seem to be tracking ahead there? And also just kind of wondering what's really resonating on the synergy side here.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Scott. Let me start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Adam. When it comes to our tracking of the revenue synergies, it's something that we look at every quarter. We look at them.We actually looked at it on our Executive Committee earlier this week. We have a combination of cross-sell, as well as new products. We've been quite successful with cross-sell. It's been our most important aspect of what we've been doing.As you know, we have a target of $350 million into the '25, '26. And we're already running ahead of our expectations for that, especially because of cross-sell. When it comes to new products, we've been successful with many right out of the box with Indices with, for example, fixed income indices, we have a fixed income VIX that we've come up with. We have a set of fixed income products that we build around ESG.We've also had multi-asset class products. But I think in Market Intelligence, we've also seen a lot of really, really strong synergies. So let me ask Adam to supplement the answer.Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market IntelligenceThanks, Doug, and thanks, Scott. It's Adam. We're very excited about our synergy progress. We've got 15 more new products that will come to market in 2024.The combination of businesses, the strength that we have in the marketplace, the receptivity of our customers to what a combined offering can do, that's all been a tremendous uplift. I think it's given us the path to achieve the revenue synergy targets that we outlined. I think what's most exciting for me and most exciting for our customers are the new products, right, where we're able to integrate new data sets into workflow solutions or give customers in private markets the ability to immediately look at public company comparables, the ability to put our fixed income capabilities into our Desktop. These are all things that roll out over the course of 2024.As Doug mentioned, the cross-sell has given us such early wind in ourselves to achieve the synergy targets we set out. As we start to roll out new products into the back half of this year, we're even more excited about what that will look like as we exit the year.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Scott.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.Shlomo Rosenbaum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystHi. Thank you very much for taking the question. Doug, maybe you could talk a little bit about -- touch on both Market Intelligence and Mobility. Just talk about the sales cycles which you're hearing from your on-the-ground guys sequentially from last quarter and then also year over year? And has there been any change in the competitive landscape with some of the new products you've put in there? If you can kind of touch on those ideas, I'd appreciate it.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerOK. Great. Well, first of all, we've been out seeing our customers, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. We've been out seeing customers everywhere we can.We've been around the globe. I myself have been traveling extensively this year seeing customers. As you know, in the financial services market, there's been a little bit of a slowdown in sales cycles. We've talked about that in the past, which we've seen.It just takes a little bit longer to close some transactions. You've heard about that from us before. In the Mobility business, there is a massive transformation taking place in the entire industry. If you think about it, you see that there's this electric vehicle transformation that's taking place.And what we've seen is that for -- whether you're an OEM, you're a supplier, you're a dealer, you need data and analytics to understand what is happening in the market. And we provide that no matter what the sales cycle is, no matter what's happening in the industry. In addition to that, we're providing new products for dealers, for OEMs for them to be able to make much more informed decisions. So as you've seen, the amount of EVs have started to stack up in ports and on dealers' lots.It's something that we can provide them much more information. The manufacturers can use that information to make decisions about how they're going to look at incentives going forward. So it's a very close dialogue, very good relationship with all sets of clients in every industry around the globe. And we're able to pivot very quickly to provide them the kind of data and analytics they need to make decisions.Thanks, Shlomo.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- AnalystGreat. Thank you. On your AI investments, obviously, you do not enhance the products you have but also improve the ongoing efficiency of the company, which is already at a high level and stuff. I'm curious, as you guys think out over the next couple of years, your internal investment spending behind AI, you've been able to do it so far within your technology budget, not a huge increase or it puts downward pressure on your margins near term.I'm just curious, do you think you can continue to hit going forward here?Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Craig. As you know, when we've been looking at our artificial intelligence road map, it's something that we've been very explicit about going back many, many years. This isn't something new for us. It started with our acquisition of Kensho six years ago.We since then have come up with a very structured approach to AI, which starts with a vision and a strategy. We've recently set in place a leadership team that's led by chief digital solutions officer and a chief artificial intelligence officer for the entire organization. We have governance over that, and the governance includes looking very cautiously and carefully at budget. We've already been absorbing AI expenses in our budget for the last six years.We're very conscious that rolling out an AI program is not inexpensive. It requires us to have that kind of discipline. And we're also tracking our successes. And we've had a lot of successes when it comes to new products, which we're starting getting -- we're getting ready to roll out.We're looking at how we can have more productivity. We hope that over time, the productivity can be returned partially through margin but also be using as a way to reinvest in innovation and growth. So overall, I think the message you should take is that we have a very structured approach to AI. It's an open ecosystem.We can take advantage of all of the AI developments happening anywhere with any large language models coming out from anybody. And we're also protecting our data in a way that we can ensure that our intellectual property is not being used by others to build great AI products that we're going to do that ourselves. So overall, we're very pleased with our progress so far, and we really appreciate -- we'll continue to bring you a lot of our progress over time. So thanks, Craig.Thanks for that.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.Jeff Meuler -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- AnalystYes. Thank you. So questions on Market Intelligence. I think, you kind of heard the angst coming into the quarter from investors, given the peer results.Adam, I was just hoping you can maybe highlight some of the MI businesses that are maybe more unique to S&P and how they're doing or maybe highlight any businesses that have already gone through some pretty significant cyclical headwinds like the Ipreo Book building Business or whatever. They just help with investor confidence regarding what's assumed over the remainder of the year through the cyclical channel launches. Thanks.Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market IntelligenceYes. Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate the question. We do have a number of unique solutions and a pretty diversified set of solutions to the marketplace.So you do see dislocations in the market or volatility affecting parts of our business differently than other parts of the business. You mentioned some of our capital markets platforms. Obviously, in the last quarter, those saw quite a lot of resilience. We saw very strong markets, particularly in credit and debt markets.Equity markets, I think, are still a little bit slower to recover, and we'll see what happens through the balance of the year. Some of our unique offerings really are around alternative assets in the loan marketplace in private markets. These are places where our workflow solutions, our valuations capability, reference data, we saw that across the firm in other divisions as well. Those are areas that continue to build and areas where we see large secular growth.Those are somewhat unique offerings for us, given our market position in some of those businesses. Across our data and reference data, pricing, valuations, those are in pretty steady demand. So they're less subject to the activity in the marketplace quarter to quarter. And that's where we see some of the stability and the general growth.What's really unique about the S&P Global offering is the scale and breadth that we can deliver to a customer. It's really being able to service them across the portfolio from discovery and research for an investment to processing the investment, monitoring it, valuing it, keeping it in a workflow tool. That set of solutions and the efficiencies we can drive through it, I think that's the biggest part of our value proposition and particularly our larger customers as they look to consolidate relationships. That gives us a bit of an advantage there.Thanks again for the question, Jeff.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Jeff.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.Russell Quelch -- Redburn Atlantic -- AnalystYes. Hi, Doug. Another really good quarter in Commodity Insights. So I was wondering if you could share what drove the 14% growth in Price Assessments in the first quarter.Is that maybe new product related? Any early feedback on Platts Connect? Is that helping drive more cross-selling? And perhaps is there upside risk to guidance here? I mean, obviously, you've upgraded guidance on some of the sort of transactional base revenue segments, but this is maybe a higher-quality revenue line. So is there upside risk here?Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes. Thank you for that, Russell. When you look at Commodity Insights, we've continued to advance incredibly well. We've had this is one of the home runs when it comes to the integration of the E&R business and the Platts business.We very quickly been able to bring together products like Price Assessments. Cross-sell has been strong if you think about being able to sell in E&R products to Platts clients, as well as selling Platts clients to E&R clients. So that was right out of the gate, a very strong approach. But we've also seen a demand -- high demand for energy transition, and we're at the sweet spot of energy transition.This relates to products like Oil and Gas, what are all of the different substitutes. It's also carbon intensity of Oil and Gas products. It goes into renewables, looking at what's happening with the renewable space. We also have a whole set of new Clean Energy and alternative energy products and services.As we've been launching an additional set of products related to metals and mining, as well as ag. So across the board, we've seen very strong results. We also had a strong quarter for CERAWeek, which is CERAWeek is a conference that took place in Houston a few weeks ago. It's the place to be for anybody that wants to understand what's happening in the energy space.So across the board, it's just been very, very strong this year. We do expect that later in the year, we're going to have tougher comps. So we looked at that very carefully as we were setting our guidance. Last year, our third and fourth quarter, especially our fourth quarter, was quite strong.So we do get toward the end of the year, and we do have a tougher comp. But overall, the Commodity Insights business is doing incredibly well. It's a broad-based business. And then, something like what you mentioned, Platts Connect has been one of the examples of a really early win and something that we're very pleased with.And you'll see more coming from Platts Connect over the next few quarters. Thanks, Russell. Thanks for the question.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.George Tong -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystHi. Thanks. Good morning. In your updated Indices guidance, can you talk about how much of the growth comes from flows versus market performance, and what you're seeing from a pricing and mix perspective from customers?Mark Grant -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsHi. George, this is Mark. The updated guidance on Indices is really driven just by strength across that business. But just giving you the underlying assumptions for the full year guide, we're expecting the S&P 500 to be essentially flat from 3/31 through the end of the year.The guidance assumes modest growth in the ETD volumes. And then, we are expecting that subscription line to accelerate a little bit as we progress through the full year.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, George.OperatorThank you. Our last question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.Owen Lau -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystGood morning, and thank you for taking my question. So just a quick follow-up on Commodity Insights, and there are lots of conversation about commodities trading, growing our U.S. customers and the prices go and things like that. How much does this volatility contribute to your business this year? And if this kind of volatility subside, how do you see the sustainability of your growth? Thanks.Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Owen. Yes, we think that that volatility is something that helps drive more people to try to understand what's happening in the markets. But as we've seen over time, the volatility doesn't seem to go away. There's always something else that comes up to create interest in the area.We do think that there are some very important long-term secular trends related to the business, which are energy transition I mentioned earlier. Energy transition is a topic that is on everybody's minds, especially when you go outside of the United States. I've been traveling this year, and I can't have a conversation anywhere I go without having a discussion about energy transition. And what are not just the impacts that we see the benefit the Commodity Insights business, but also those that benefit businesses like the Ratings business and Market Intelligence because those are moving also over into how do you finance energy transition question as well, which crosses into our other divisions.Finally, with Commodity Insights, you can recall that this business is principally a subscription-based business. And so, we can see over time the subscription flow, where we're seeing the growth coming from the new customers coming into the portfolio. There's something that I say all the time that every single company is an energy company. It doesn't matter what you do, energy company.And so, we also see an expanding set of new clients that aren't necessary traditional energy companies that are needing the solutions we have so they can manage their own energy footprint. So Owen, thank you very much for that. And I think you were the last call. So let me give a couple of closing remarks.I really want to thank everyone today for being on this call and for your excellent questions as usual. This was a great quarter, and we're really pleased with the results. And we think this validates our strategy, but it also showcases our execution. As I mentioned, I've been very busy traveling around the world this year, speaking with customers across all of our businesses and from every industry.And in those meetings, we're hearing that the themes that we have, that we have the strength in this franchise are those that the customers need going forward. And that includes things like energy transition and private markets and supply chain and credit and risk. But it also includes artificial intelligence, and I'm pleased that we've been able to roll out in our road map many, many new capabilities and products and services to protect our IP, but also to take a leadership position in AI. I want to thank Martina and Adam for providing their perspectives today on this call.And I also want to thank our people across the company as usual for a fantastic quarter. And again, thank all of you for joining the call today, and hope you have a great day. Thank you very much.OperatorThat concludes this morning's call.

            -10.56% ","The biggest driver of headlines across the technology sector over the past year or so has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.With that as a backdrop, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) slumped 3.4%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.To be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and what it means for other big players in the AI space.<img alt=""An angry person with hands outstretched looking at a computer monitor."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JLV0BYPllEC.aw92n5Hyew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/60203c5dc29495f50d8ac00aeaf5decc class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.You have to spend money to make moneyMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.The company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.The results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.Like its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, ""there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,"" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.Meta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, ""We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.""As a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, ""We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap."" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.Story continuesUnited in the pursuit of AISo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.Company-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:UBS analyst Stephen Ju maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock, but raised his price target to $215, which suggests 22% upside compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees potential for improvement in a broad cross-section of Amazon's business interests this year. This follows two price target increases by other analysts yesterday.Chinese hackers accessed U.S. government emails last year, something Microsoft could have prevented, according to a report by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has lost face and is working to rebuild trust in its systems, according to numerous reports.The potential for a TikTok ban, which was signed into law today by President Biden, could benefit Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, according to a report in The Washington Post.Investors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.<img alt=""MSFT Chart"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8WQQPZdqXYj2MSTL_6hjzw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTcxNztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/447455c50dafff1be4894f579f50d320 class=caas-img>MSFT ChartWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling.

That's ahead of Wall Street's expectations for $2.17 per share in earnings on sales of $9.03 billion.Operating margin improved by 130 basis points year over year to 20.4% thanks to strength in commercial aviation, defense, and space. Honeywell's backlog of future business grew by 6% to $32 billion.But sales in more economically sensitive areas including industrial automation were down, a reflection of customers being unwilling to commit to new spending at a time when the health of the economy seems uncertain.CEO Vimal Kapur said Honeywell is experiencing ""pockets of recovery"" in these so-called short-cycle businesses and is expecting ""broader participation as the year unfolds and channels normalize.""The question is how soon that recovery will come.

That day is coming, but it appears it could be more of a story in the second half of 2024 than something we will see this quarter.In the meantime, the company continues to deploy its cash for bolt-on acquisitions as well as dividends and share repurchases, offering shareholders a 2.25% yield at current prices while they wait for a recovery.

            -10.56% ","Meta stock (META) fell more than 10% on Thursday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the social media company is pouring more cash into its AI efforts, spooking investors.The CEO, however, tried to assuage investor concerns about the company’s spending during Wednesday’s earnings call, noting that Meta has made similar moves when transitioning to other new technologies in the past.“We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook, where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with Reels, Stories, as Newsfeed transitioned to mobile, and more,” Zuckerberg said.But he also admitted that it will likely take years before Meta turns a profit on its AI investments. In January, Zuckerberg announced via an Instagram post that Meta will purchase some 350,000 Nvidia H100 AI chips by the end of the year. While Nvidia doesn’t release the exact price of its data center chips, estimates indicate they cost anywhere between $20,000 and $40,000 apiece. That would put Meta’s estimated costs well into the billions of dollars.<img alt=""FILE PHOTO: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a speech, as the letters AI for artificial intelligence appear on screen, at the Meta Connect event at the company&#39;s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 27, 2023.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)Meta CFO Susan Li backed up Zuckerberg’s statements in her earnings note commentary, raising the company's full-year total expenses estimate from a range of between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. Li said that the company’s investments will also increase in the years ahead.""While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,"" Li said.While Wall Street’s early reaction to Zuckerberg’s comments may have turned off some investors, experts say the investments will likely pay off in the long run more than, say, the company’s metaverse play.“There’s no doubt that Meta is all in on AI but to achieve its vision, the company must make big investments in infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg’s ‘heads up’ was reminiscent of what he once said about the metaverse,” Forrester vice president and research director Mike Proulx said in a statement.“That didn’t exactly go so well, but this is different than Meta’s metaverse gamble because AI has real and practical use cases now. The question remains whether Meta can contend in the AI race while maintaining a strong financial position,” he added.William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart, meanwhile, said that while the timing and scale of Meta’s generative AI investments will be larger and longer than its prior build-outs, making moves now will put Meta in a more competitive position against rivals.Story continues“We believe [Meta] is still exercising prudence in spending and ultimately will be one of the leaders in the AI race. However, this may take some time and further proof points to investors,” he wrote in an investor note.Meta’s AI investments include two divisions, one dedicated to consumer users and the other focusing on advertisers. On the consumer front, there’s the company’s new Meta AI chatbot which answers users’ general knowledge questions. Then there’s Meta AI’s customer side, which allows advertisers to build out advertising campaigns on the company’s social platforms using AI.<img alt=""Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PffxtL2jp44Irq548PJVHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ4MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-01/7bb04d80-bed4-11ee-b7b7-f9706ecb81fc class=caas-img>Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

            -8.25% HCP
            +4.49% ","Shares of IBM (NYSE: IBM) took a hard hit on Thursday, following the release of first-quarter results and the announcement of a $6.4 billion acquisition in the cloud computing space. The results were solid enough, but IBM investors wanted a stronger artificial intelligence (AI) push. As a result, IBM shares traded 9.6% lower at noon ET.IBM's busy dayLet's start with the earnings report. First-quarter sales rose 1.5% year over year, landing at $14.5 billion. That's a rounding error away from the consensus analyst projection of $14.6 billion. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased by 24% to $1.68 per diluted share. Here, your average analyst would have settled for $1.60 per share. All in all, that's a solid print.Management doubled down on the full-year financial forecast it provided three months ago. As a reminder, that means single-digit revenue growth with free cash flow of roughly $12 billion in 2024 as a whole.Meanwhile, IBM is buying HashiCorp for $35 per share, an all-cash deal with an enterprise value of $6.4 billion. HashiCorp specializes in monitoring and automation of cloud computing operations across multiple cloud platforms. Expected to close before the end of the year, the deal has been approved by both companies' boards of directors but still needs the usual range of regulatory and shareholder approvals.IBM expects HashiCorp's services to unlock synergies with its hybrid cloud computing platforms, built around the $34 billion Red Hat buyout in 2019.Buy the news?Big Blue's market cap lost more than $14 billion of value on Thursday, or more than double HashiCorp's price tag. HashiCorp's stock only gained roughly 5% today, but the stock jumped more than 20% two days ago as the rumor mill started speculating about an IBM deal.In the end, Wall Street saw the potential HashiCorp acquisition coming and the announcement wasn't much of a surprise. And as you saw earlier, the earnings report was robust. Yet, IBM's stock price plunged today.The price drop makes sense for two reasons.First, IBM entered last night's report on a full head of steam, and the stock had gained 47% over the preceding 52 weeks. Merely solid results weren't enough to keep that momentum going.Second, some investors worry about the way IBM's revenue streams are shifting. Currency-adjusted consulting revenue was flat year over year while software sales increased by 6%.That being said, IBM's backlog of AI-related consulting contracts now stands at more than $1 billion, up from ""the low hundreds of millions"" two quarters ago. The company's AI muscles are flexing, but it will take some time before the backlog is converted into paid-up revenue and cash profits.Story continuesInvestors are often impatient, preferring quick results over long-term profit plans. In my eyes, IBM is building a valuable AI machine for the long haul, and price drops like this one should be seen as buying opportunities. After all, the stock trades at merely 2.5 times sales and 12 times free cash flow today -- a bargain compared to the expensive market darlings you see elsewhere in today's AI market.Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mortgage-rates-wild-card-housing-175959680.html,Mortgage rates are a ‘wild card’ in the housing market—and they’re edging closer to 8%,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 1:59 PM EDT",,"For a while, it seemed as though mortgage rates traveled to the back of everyone’s mind. They’d fallen below 7%, and something about a mortgage rate that begins with a six appealed to people, even though it was still more than double pandemic-era rates.But for the first time all year, last week, mortgage rates surpassed 7%. And today, Freddie Mac’s weekly reading showed that the 30-year fixed rate mortgage just hit 7.17%. (Daily mortgage rates are trending higher: 7.52%, as of the latest reading.) But as you can see, they’ve reemerged at the forefront of the housing conversation on the back of sticky inflation and interest-rate cuts that are further away—and as we know, mortgage rates are somewhat of a game changer in the housing world.“Mortgage rates continue to be a wild card, and although they topped 7% for the first time in 2024 last week, they are in territory that was charted last fall when rates approached 8%,” Realtor.com’s chief economist, Danielle Hale, wrote in a weekly housing market report.Whether or not that means mortgage rates will top 8% again, we’re close to that more than two-decade high seen in October last year. The effect of that could be felt soon, if not already. “So far, sellers continue to put homes on the market more frequently than last year, but mortgage rates could cause a pullback in this figure as nearly three-quarters of potential sellers are also trying to buy a home,” Hale wrote.By Realtor.com’s weekly measure, new listings are up from a year earlier, and so is active inventory. But according to Redfin’s monthly update, new listings slowed in March, dropping 6% on a monthly basis, which happens to be the largest decline in about two years. They are higher than last year, but rose at a much slower pace compared to Febuary’s 14% annual gain. Active listings rose 1% in March from the previous month, the smallest increase since the end of summer.“​​New listings may have slowed because mortgage rates are staying higher longer than expected, which is exacerbating the lock-in effect,” Redfin’s data journalist, Lily Katz, wrote. “The average 30-year-fixed mortgage rate in March was 6.82%—the highest since December—and the Federal Reserve has warned that elevated inflation will probably delay the interest-rate cuts they had been planning this year.”Fed Chair Jerome Powell pretty much confirmed that theory last week when he said more time was needed for restrictive policy to work and that the Fed would leave interest rates where they are for as long as necessary to tame inflation.Existing home sales fell in March too: 4.3% on a monthly basis and 3.7% on an annual basis. “Home sales are stuck because interest rates have not made any major moves,” National Association of Realtors’ chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said in the release—although pending home sales jumped in March.Story continuesStill, it’s starting to seem like mortgage rates in the 7% range for the year are becoming more and more likely. Earlier this week, Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas, said: “A new reality is setting in with homebuyers that we’re not going to go back to those pandemic lows anytime soon, given the very soft landing in the economy, persistent inflation pressures, which are trending lower but taking some time to move there—and that means elevated mortgage rates with a seven as the first number as opposed to two during the pandemic.”Others, however, see them falling a bit further. Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, recently said in a statement that “we are likely to see rates close to 7% throughout the spring, and in the mid-to-high-6s into the summer.” Capital Economics reaffirmed its mortgage-rate outlook (despite the fact that it changed its interest-rate forecast) in an analysis published today: “We still expect mortgage rates to come down from 7.2% to 6.5% by the end of this year,” the firm’s property economist, Thomas Ryan, wrote.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comView comments"

            +0.57% ","(Bloomberg) -- EQT AB is tapping a group of direct lenders for around $1 billion of debt to help finance its acquisition of Avetta LLC at one of the cheapest rates seen in the private credit market, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Most Read from BloombergUS Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing HopesMalaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest CityBig Tech Surges in Late Hours on Blowout Earnings: Markets WrapJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in WorldBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll ShowsThe new loan is expected to price at 4.5 percentage points over the benchmark rate, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private transaction. That would mean a 1.25 percentage point cut on the margin compared to the company’s existing credit facility, which it received about six months ago, according to filings.The quick turnaround in pricing comes as the $1.7 trillion private credit market’s biggest competitor — Wall Street banks — have benefited from a resurgence in the leveraged loan market. To avoid losing market share to institutional investors that buy leveraged loans, direct lenders have been agreeing to slash prices on sought-after deals. Competition between private credit firms has also intensified because of the lack of new leveraged buyouts.Read more: Wall Street Reclaims $16 Billion of Deals Lost to Private CreditAres Management Corp., AllianceBernstein Holding LP, Golub Capital and Blue Owl Capital Inc. are in discussions to lend the money, the people added.

The loan is being discussed at a discounted price of 99 cents on the dollar, one of the people added.Representatives for EQT, Avetta, Ares, and Blue Owl declined to comment. Representatives for AllianceBernstein and Golub didn’t respond to requests for comment.Recent private credit deals have seen pricing of around 5 to 5.5 percentage points over the benchmark rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Last year, that level could exceed 7 percentage points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate.Borrowing CostsDespite potentially snagging one of the cheapest private loans, Avetta’s leverage — a ratio of debt compared to earnings — would be around 7 times, the people said.That is relatively high compared to other deals with low borrowing costs, such as Blackstone Inc.’s acquisition of Rover Group, which had leverage of around 4 times and saw borrowing costs of 4.75 percentage points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Iris Software’s recent refinancing priced at the same level.Story continuesEQT is paying about 24 times Avetta’s projected 2024 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $125 million — or about $3 billion — to buy the supply chain risk-management software provider, Bloomberg earlier reported.The loan-to-value ratio is relatively conservative at roughly 25%, meaning EQT will put in a significant amount of equity, the people said.Read more: EQT Agrees to Buy Welsh Carson’s Compliance Risk Firm AvettaEQT announced its plan to acquire Avetta earlier this month from Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe.

We are reacting and replanning quickly to mitigate the operational and financial impacts while maintaining dependable and reliable flight schedules for our customers.""While the airline brought in $6.33 billion in revenue (up 11% from a year ago), the costs of operations as well as the problems with Boeing deliveries all contributed to an unprofitable quarter. Jordan said that the decision to exit the four airports was made independently of one season’s earnings or the problems with Boeing as flying out of them was proving unprofitable on a wider scale.Story continues“We are focused on controlling what we can control and have already taken swift action to address our financial underperformance and adjust for revised aircraft delivery expectations,"" Jordan told investors.Also on Thursday, American Airlines  (AAL)  posted a first-quarter loss of $312 million or 46 cents per share. The airline expects to earn between $1.15 and $1.45 per share in the second quarter but the fall from $10 million in profit during the same quarter a year ago reflects similar pressures that Southwest is facing.""While we aren't satisfied with our first-quarter financial results, we have a strong foundation in place, and we remain on track to deliver on our full-year financial targets,"" American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said in a statement.View comments (16)"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happening-markets-april-25-173720934.html,Here is What is Happening in Markets: April 25,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 1:37 PM EDT",,"ETF Investing Tools

Markets are in the red to kick off the trading day on Thursday after the Commerce Department reported that the economy had slowed.

Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.6% in the first quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday, less than the 2.2% economists had forecast. The growth rate was a sharp slowdown from the last quarter of 2023, when the U.S. economy grew by 3.4%.

As markets slipped, broad index ETFs also fell. SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust fell 1.2% after the open while DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust lost 1.6%. According to etf.com data, SPY was one of the most active ETFs on Thursday with a trading volume of nearly 15 million as markets dipped.

Bond yields jumped Thursday as investors digested the data about a weakening economy. Yields have an inverse relationship to prices and as bond prices fell, TLT, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF also slipped, falling nearly 1% in midmorning trading. Fixed income traders have been on a rollercoaster ride in 2024 as investors questioned whether the Fed would cut interest rates—and when.

BND, the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF and AGG, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF were also under pressure on Thursday. Both funds invest in the wider bond market.

Slowing economic growth would typically be good news for investors betting on rate cuts. If the economy starts the weaken, the belief is that the Fed will cut rates to help stimulate economic growth. But personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 3.4% in the first quarter, compared to a 1.8% jump in the last quarter of 2023.

The acceleration in PCE—the Fed's preferred inflation gauge—highlights persistent and stubborn levels of inflation. With inflation here to stay, today's report torpedoed investor hopes that rate cuts were coming any time soon.

According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, investors aren't expecting rate cuts until September.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq was also in the red after Meta reported their earnings on Wednesday. QQQ, the Invesco QQQ Trust slid over 1.5% while MAGS, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF which invests in the Magnificent Seven stocks, sank 2.5%.

While Meta reported beats in both earnings and revenue, the tech giant's outlook for second quarter earnings fell short of expectations.

See you again first thing tomorrow.06:26 PM BSTWPP hit by slump in tech ad spendingWPP has posted a decline in revenue over the first quarter as the advertising giant was hit by lower spending by tech companies and the loss of major client Pfizer.The London-listed company posted revenues of £2.7bn in the first three months of the year, a decline of 1.6pc on a like-for-like basis and its weakest quarter since the end of 2020.WPP pointed to a “challenging” period for its largest market of North America as tech giants continue to trim their advertising budgets amid a wider economic downturn.Bosses also blamed delays to projects as clients showed greater caution and the loss of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer from its creative agencies.WPP was also hit by economic troubles in China, where revenues tumbled more than 15pc because of a slowdown in the automotive and luxury industries. The UK was a relative bright spot, posting growth of 0.3pc.Shares fell as much as 3pc following the trading update.Story continues06:15 PM BSTGSK accuses Pfizer of infringing patents with its Covid-19 vaccine in US lawsuitGSK has accused Pfizer in a US lawsuit of infringing patents in its Covid-19 vaccine.The FTSE 100 drugmaker has claimed that Pfizer and BioNTech infringed its patented mRNA technology, which it said it had been developing a decade before the outbreak of the pandemic, according to court filings.Lucy Burton has the story:GSK has argued that the invention has solved the problem of transporting fragile molecules of genetic code into human cells. The code then teaches cells to make antibodies.A GSK spokesman said the company “believes that these patents provided the foundational technology used in Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. We are willing to license these patents on commercially reasonable terms and to ensure continued patient access”.In court documents it argued that it was “entitled to an award of monetary damages, including a reasonable royalty”. The Pfizer/BioNTech shot was approved by UK regulators in 2020, becoming the first ever vaccine made using revolutionary mRNA technology to get the official go ahead.Experts have argued that the “plug and play” element of mRNA technology means that vaccines are relatively quick and straightforward to manufacture, paving the way for new inoculations against emerging infectious diseases.The court filing bought by GSK on Thursday marks the latest legal tussle involving vaccine technology and the latest spat between GSK and Pfizer, with the companies currently locked in a patent dispute over a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.It also mirrors a case brought by Moderna against Pfizer and BioNTech in 2022, when it was seeking compensation for the continued use of its jab which it said breached patent laws.A BioNTech spokesman said the business is “aware that GSK has filed an action for infringement with respect to five patents” but will not comment on its legal strategy.Pfizer did not respond to requests for comment but told Reuters that it is “confident in our IP position” around the Covid vaccine and intends to “vigorously defend” itself against GSK’s claims.06:08 PM BSTFTSE 100 closes at another record highThe FTSE 100 closed at another record high after being uplifted by a series of strong earnings reports and renewed takeover activity.The blue-chip index climbed 38.48 points or 0.48pc to end the day at 8,078.86.The performance was driven by BHP’s £31bn takeover bid for Anglo American, sending shares in the mining firm higher.The FTSE 100 was also boosted Barclays, AstraZeneca and Unilever, which all saw their share prices increase in response to trading updates.06:05 PM BSTAirbus turns screw on rival BoeingAirbus revealed plans to lift production of its biggest airliner, tapping into the rebound in demand for long-haul travel as rival Boeing remains gripped by crisis.My colleague Christopher Jasper reports:The European manufacturer aims to make 12 of the A350 jets a month in 2028, surpassing a pre-Covid level of 10 that it’s planning to return to in 2026.Inter-continental flights are on the up as family visits and business trips continue to bounce back after the sector was hardest hit during the coronavirus outbreak, and luxury holidays come back into vogue.Airbus said it remains on course to churn out 74 of its best-selling A320 single-aisle planes by 2026, leaving Boeing’s rival 737 Max trailing as the US firm grapples with the latest safety crisis, prompted by the blowout of a door panel on an Alaska Airlines plane in January.An extra-long-range addition to the A320 family should enter service in the third quarter, consolidating the European firm’s dominance in the lucrative short-haul market.Airbus posted a 9pc revenue increase in the first quarter as it delivered 142 airliners, 15 more than a year earlier, though adjusted profit slipped, partly due to record participation in an employee share offer.Chief executive Guillaume Faury said that Airbus’s ramp up plans are continuing, albeit against a background of  “an operating environment that shows no sign of improvement,” with geopolitical and supply-chain tensions.Boeing handed over only 83 planes in the first quarter, down from 130 the year before, as it slowed customer deliveries in order to improve safety checks and iron out production faults following the Alaska Airlines incident, it announced this week.Losses at Boeing’s airliner division almost doubled and the operating cash outflow jumped 10-fold to £3.4bn.Airbus aims to deliver 800 airlines this year and is targeting a profit as high as €7bn.04:14 PM BSTPwC UK picks new leaderBig Four accountancy firm PwC has elected its new leader.The professional services firm elected Marco Amitrano as its new senior partner its UK and Middle East operations.He replaces Kevin Ellis, who will step down after eight years at the helm.Mr Amitrano, currently the firm’s UK managing partner and head of clients and markets, will take the over from July 1.He beat Laura Hinton, head of tax, and Hemione Hudson, head of audit, who were both the first ever women in PwC’s history to be nominated for the top job.03:33 PM BSTPound hit as US interest rates expected to stay highThe pound reduced its gains as money markets indicated that the US Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for longer.Sterling has risen 0.2pc on the day but has fallen back below $1.25 after an earlier rise of 0.6pc. The pound was up 0.1pc against the euro, which is worth less than 86p.It comes as traders delayed their expectations for the first interest rate cut in the US, which is now priced in by December rather than November.Elsewhere in markets, Brent crude oil has fallen 0.5pc below $88 a barrel amid declining tensions in the Middle East.However, European gas prices have risen as much as 3.1pc after a drop in temperatures coincided with a reduction in supplies from Norway.I am heading off now but the live updates will keep coming into the evening courtesy of Adam Mawardi.03:18 PM BSTMeta loses £136bn amid AI investment worriesShares of Meta Platforms have fallen as much as 13pc, sparking a selloff in big technology stocks after the social media firm signaled its costly bet on AI could take years to pay off.The drop was set to erase nearly $170bn (£136.2bn) from the company’s market value and triggered a fall of 3pc to 4.2pc in shares of AI-focused Microsoft and Alphabet and advertising-reliant Snap.Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who floored Wall Street last year with his cost-cutting drive, said on a post-earnings call that costs would grow “meaningfully” over the coming years before the company makes “much revenue” from some of its AI products.That stoked investor fears that Mr Zuckerberg was plunging Meta into another costly endeavour at a time when its augmented and virtual reality business was losing billions of dollars each quarter.Baird Equity Research analysts said: “Investors were caught off guard by higher capital expenditure, exacerbated by slightly softer second-quarter revenue guide. As such, shares are entering the ‘penalty box.’”03:11 PM BSTSteel unions to go on strike as Tata rejects planUnions say their alternative plan to avoid thousands of job losses at Tata has been rejected by the steel company.Unions met the company in London today with another plea not to press ahead with its proposals for its plant in Port Talbot, South Wales.Unite said it would press ahead with industrial action Tata’s decision to shut both blast furnaces and shed 2,800 jobs, with strike dates to be announced soon.Tata Steel has insisted its £1.3bn plan for a state-of-the-art electric arc furnace in Port Talbot would be the largest investment in the steel industry for decades and would secure the future of UK steelmaking.A spokesman said: “It would protect the majority of jobs, reduce the UK’s carbon emissions by five million tonnes a year and could kickstart a green industrial revolution in South Wales.”The Community union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said after the meeting:It’s incredibly disappointing that Tata have chosen to reject the multi-union plan, which is an ambitious and viable alternative to their destructive bad deal for steel.We do not accept the company’s assertion our plan was too expensive - in fact, it would have returned the company to profits, and the additional capital expenditure needed to make it a reality could have been funded by an additional £450m from the government - a drop in the water compared to what other European countries are investing in their domestic steel industries.Tata have made their decision, and our members will decide on our collective response.02:41 PM BSTMining mega merger could fall away amid sensitivity, say analystsAs more voices oppose the potential takeover of Anglo American by BHP, Quilter Cheviot analyst Jamie Maddock said:Following this morning’s blockbuster news that BHP has initiated informal discussions with Anglo American for a potential all-share offer at £25 per share, the market is clearly expecting this attempt to be rebuffed.The fact that the shares are trading just above what BHP is offering suggests one of two things – either BHP is going to up its offer or sweeten the deal in some way, or a second offer comes forward from another diversified miner like Glencore.The deal premium feels relatively low, particularly in the context of recent M&A offers and the heightened complexity hence something above £30 per share could be likely to get it done.This is a complex and potentially political deal, as well as being another blow to the London market. Given the unusual complexity and sensitivity it wouldn’t be a complete surprise to see the deal fall away.However, in-light of industry’s interest to acquire what is an under-valued asset, the pressure on management to be more active to close the obvious valuation discount will only increase. Even today, following the share price recovery it still trades at an unusually wide discount to its fair value.02:34 PM BSTWall Street plunges amid US stagflation fearsUS stock markets plunged amid fears of stagflation in the American economy.Shares on Wall Street plummeted as official figures showed US GDP grew less than expected in the first three months of the year.The growth of 1.6pc was

by 2.2pc to 15,360.15, as more than $190bn (£152bn) was wiped off the value of Meta.The FTSE 100 has been unaffected by the tech sell-off due to its heavy focus towards the financial sector and commodities, and remains 0.1pc higher despite the US economic data.02:08 PM BSTTraders push back expectations for first US rate cutTraders have pushed back their expectations for the first interest rate cut in the US after a closely-watched measure of inflation came in higher than expected.Money markets indicate that the first rate reduction will take place by December, having been priced in by November before the latest data released.The core PCE prices index, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, showed inflation rose to 3.7pc during the first quarter, ahead of analyst expectations of 3.4pc.It comes after separate figures showed the US economy grew less than expected in the first three months of the year at 1.6pc.Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets said: “Stagflation chatter will surely pick up in the wake of these figures, but we’re less concerned with such an outcome as long as the labour market remains so strong.”Charles Schwab UK managing director Richard Flynn said: “Looking ahead, we might expect to see these figures temper the bullish narrative that pushed the market to record highs in the first few months of this year.”01:51 PM BSTUS growth slows down in blow to BidenThe US economy grew less than anticipated in the first three months of 2024, according to government data, as consumer spending and exports decelerated.The world’s biggest economy grew 1.6pc in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said, which was markedly lower than analysts’ expectations of 2.4pc.This was also a cooldown from the 3.4pc increase seen in the final three months of last year.While the latest figure still shows expansion, economic pressures could weigh on President Joe Biden as he seeks reelection in November.The Commerce Department said the slowing “primarily reflected decelerations in consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending”.There was also a “downturn in federal government spending,” the report said.For now, consumers remain willing to spend “even if they are being more scrutinous in the face of high prices,” said EY chief economist Gregory Daco.“Looking ahead, we see the economy gently cooling as slower labor demand, easing wage growth, stubborn inflation, and tight credit conditions constrain private sector activity,” he added.🇺🇸 US Economy: Disappointing Spring🌸📉Real #GDP in Q1 2024 ✅+1.6% q/q

warned that the mining sector remains a “critical part of the South African economy,” as it examines the £31.1bn takeover offer from BHP.A spokesman for Public Investment Corporation (PIC) said it will “assess any offers that are presented to shareholders and will engage directly with the investee companies,” adding:The PIC is a long-term investor and any transaction presented will be assessed to ensure value creation for our clients.In addition, the mining sector remains a critical part of the South African economy, impacting a wide variety of stakeholders, therefore, new opportunities that may arise in the sector need to take these factors and long-term sustainability into account.01:29 PM BSTAnglo American shareholders criticise ‘opportunistic’ takeover bidShareholders in Anglo American have criticised the potential £31.1bn takeover of the mining giant by BHP.Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions at Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), which is Anglo American’s 11th largest shareholder, said:We note with concern the news that BHP have made what we regard as a highly opportunistic approach to Anglo American.As with many other UK listed companies, we believe the valuation of Anglo American to be depressed and regard the proposed exchange ratio as an unattractive proposition for long term investors.The mining industry has a vital role to play in the energy transition.The industry is extremely concentrated today, and further consolidating it will not contribute to accelerating investment in the way we believe is needed.If the industry is not able to develop the significant new supply of critical minerals the world urgently requires our transition to a low carbon economy may be placed at risk.01:26 PM BSTSouth African minister criticises £31.1bn takeover bid for Anglo AmericanSouth Africa’s minerals resources minister has criticised the attempted takeover of FTSE 100 mining giant Anglo American by Australian rival BHP, raising doubts about the £31.1bn deal.Gwede Mantashe said he was against the tie-up, which would create the world’s largest copper miner.He said South Africa’s previous experience with Anglo American’s Australian suitor, which claims to be the world’s largest mining company, was “not positive”.BHP merged with South African miner Billiton in 2001 but Mr Mantashe said the transaction, which led to the formation of BHP Billiton “never did much for South Africa”.“What we saw is that it dumped coal and then created a small company called South32, which is now marginal,” he told the Financial Times.12:57 PM BSTLondon

But the real risk for rail passengers is Angela Rayner’s policy to bring back French-style, low threshold, zero warning strikes which will disrupt rail services.That’s because within their first 100 days Labour will reverse all the trade union laws we have passed, making it much easier for rail unions to strike.It’s the same old Labour, handing more power to the unions which will mean worse services for passengers.10:46 AM BSTDeutsche Bank profits soar amid strong investment bankingDeutsche Bank reported a 10pc jump in first-quarter profits amid booming business at its investment banking division.Earnings at Germany’s biggest bank came in at €1.3bn (£1.1bn), up from €1.2bn a year earlier, while sales rose 1pc to €7.8bn, better than analysts had predicted.Revenues at the group’s investment banking jumped 13pc, propelled by an increase in deal-making.In contrast, sales at the retail banking division declined slightly year on year, as the effect of the European Central Bank’s interest rate increases faded.Banks globally had profited from rising borrowing costs but most central banks are now holding rates steady, and moving towards making cuts, as inflation eases.Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing said: “We again generated solid revenue momentum in an environment of normalising interest rates, thanks to a well-balanced business model.”The German lender has undergone major restructuring in recent years, seeking to rely more on retail and corporate banking, after an aggressive shift in the early 2000s into investment banking saw it embroiled in multiple scandals.<img alt=""Deutsche Bank&#39;s offices in London"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XMB7a.VICBDS7gMs9kOhYg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwMDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/9faf81b501b2a6c1cd94388c7d5e3c6a class=caas-img>Deutsche Bank's offices in London - REUTERS/Toby Melville10:29 AM BSTNo plans to renationalise water industry, says LabourRenationalising the water industry is not currently within Labour’s plans, Louise Haigh said, as she stressed her rail plan meets the party’s “ironclad” spending constraints.Announcing her plan to renationalise the railways, the shadow transport secretary said they have become a “symbol of national decline” under the Conservatives.Asked about whether Labour would consider bringing other services into public ownership, she told journalists:I think what the plans today and other plans we have set out in areas show (is) that where the settlement isn’t working we are prepared to take the tough action that is needed.We have, as I have set out, and Rachel Reeves has repeatedly set out, ironclad fiscal rules. These reforms are within them because we won’t have to pay compensation when the railway operations contracts expire.Water is a different settlement because we would have to nationalise the businesses and it could cost the taxpayer billions of pounds, and in the constrained fiscal environment we don’t think that is immediately the right priority.Instead we would set out plans for regulation and for tough legislation, criminal sanctions on water directors who dump sewage in our waters, and regulation to ensure they invest in infrastructure and it is the water companies that pay the price, not consumers.Speaking at Trainline headquarters in central London, Ms Haigh also pointed to plans for publicly owned energy company Great British Energy to “act as a challenger to the energy market as well”, describing this as a “pragmatic” offer.10:20 AM BSTBiden hands Micron $13bn of support to set up US chip factoriesMicron has been given access to more than $13bn (£10.4bn) of US government support to help build semiconductor plants in New York and Idaho, the White House has said.The American chip manufacturer will be given  $6.1bn in direct funding and up to $7.5bn in loans under a preliminary deal.New York senator Chuck Schumer said the investment will help Micron “to bring back leading-edge memory chip manufacturing to the United States for the first time in 20 years”.It is the latest in a series of awards as President Joe Biden seeks to bring semiconductor production back to the US.Micron is expected to invest up to $125bn across both states over the next two decades “to build a leading-edge memory manufacturing ecosystem,” according to the White House.<img alt=""Micron is poised to invest up to $125bn over the next two decades in exchange for US government support"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SQ5Nfh9MhY9CD_1vykIDIA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwMDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/2af97ae86e98e92fd2151b9f31197c98 class=caas-img>Micron is poised to invest up to $125bn over the next two decades in exchange for US government support -

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-backed-rubriks-stock-jumps-165628469.html,Microsoft-backed Rubrik's stock jumps 21% in NYSE debut,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 2:43 PM EDT","MSFT
            -2.45% GS
            -0.71% ","(Reuters) -Rubrik's shares climbed nearly 21% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, giving the Microsoft-backed cybersecurity firm a valuation of $6.77 billion.

The startup joins a list of companies that have seen strong debuts recently as initial public offerings (IPOs) bounce back on hopes of a soft landing for the economy, where inflation falls without a recession or big job losses.

The rapid adoption of cloud applications for data storage and transfer has left businesses vulnerable to malicious attacks via the internet and boosted the appeal of cybersecurity firms.

Palo Alto, California-based Rubrik provides data security solutions to more than 6,100 customers including appliance maker Whirlpool, snacks and beverages giant PepsiCo and investment bank Goldman Sachs.

Initially named ScaleData, Rubrik competes with data management and protection vendors including Cohesity, Commvault, Veeam, IBM and Dell EMC.

The company's stock opened at $38.6, higher than the $32 IPO price, and were last trading at $37. Rubrik raised $752 million in the IPO.

The strong debut comes against the backdrop of weakness in the broader equities market. The Russell 2000 Index, which measures the performance of small-cap U.S. equities, has dropped nearly 7% so far this month.

Rubrik was founded in late 2013, but only began offering products and services in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2016. It is led by co-founder and CEO Bipul Sinha, who is also a venture partner at Silicon Valley's technology investment firm Lightspeed Venture Partners.

Microsoft made an equity investment in Rubrik in 2021 in a financing round that valued the startup at $4 billion. Venture capital firms Greylock Partners and Lightspeed have also backed the company.

The IPO was underwritten by a syndicate of more than a dozen banks including Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citigroup and Wells Fargo Securities.

            -3.53% ","Shares of auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY) sank on Thursday after the company reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024. As of noon ET, O'Reilly stock was down 4% but it had been down as much as 8% earlier in the day.A good quarter for O'Reilly despite the negative reaction from investorsI readily admit that the negative reaction to O'Reilly's financial results from investors is a head-scratcher. Many headlines say that O'Reilly stock is down because of disappointment regarding its profit outlook. However, the company raised its outlook for profits today. Therefore, that explanation doesn't seem to hold water.To be clear, the numbers looked good for O'Reilly. The company's sales increased 7% year over year to nearly $4 billion, bolstered by strong same-store sales growth of over 3%. Moreover, its net income was up 6% to $547 million.Granted, one might nitpick O'Reilly because its sales increased more than its profits in Q1, meaning its profit margin went down. But the company still had a Q1 profit margin of almost 14%, which is nothing to sneeze at.What should investors do now?O'Reilly is one of the very best auto parts retailers and the business is fine. However, investors might want to consider its valuation today before buying shares. The company expects about $2 billion in free cash flow this year, meaning it trades at about 31 times this year's free cash flow. As the chart below shows, that's high compared to its 10-year average.<img alt=""ORLY Price to Free Cash Flow Chart"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2RNRuf3OFWGDN3aiEiJuqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU4ODtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/1de340815bd6ddb9dafa9427dc49121a class=caas-img>ORLY Price to Free Cash Flow ChartO'Reilly routinely buys back its stock with profits to boost shareholder value. Its share count is down about 24% over the last five years. In coming quarters, management will keep repurchasing shares as it's done in the past. But when the stock trades at a higher valuation, like it does right now, those repurchases aren't quite as effective.For shareholders, there's no reason to worry about O'Reilly's business -- it's doing well. But some investors might want to wait on the sidelines before starting a position, waiting for a better valuation.Should you invest $1,000 in O'Reilly Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in O'Reilly Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and O'Reilly Automotive wasn’t one of them.

            -5.82% ","Cable internet giant Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) stock slipped 6% through 11:11 a.m. ET Thursday despite the company reporting better than expected sales and earnings for the first quarter of 2024.Analysts had forecast the communications company would earn only $0.99 per share (non-GAAP, or adjusted) on sales of $29.8 billion in Q1, but Comcast surprised to the upside with $1.04 per share in earnings and sales of $30.1 billion. Yet its stock fell. Why?Comcast's Q1 earnings reportComcast's news wasn't all good. While the company beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, revenue still only grew about 1% year over year, and net income rose less than 1%.Still, by buying back shares (so that what net income there was, was divvied up among fewer shares), Comcast managed to grow its earnings per share 6.5%, to $0.97 according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). What's more, Comcast's free cash flow for the quarter surged nearly 20%, to $4.5 billion, which was better than reported net income.Also of interest: Comcast grew its broadband internet revenue 4% -- 4 times faster than total revenue growth. And the company increased its wireless customer subscriber count by 21%, to 6.9 million subscribers.Is Comcast stock a buy?Still, the number that interests me most is Comcast's free cash flow, which grew tremendously. At $16.8 billion, FCF now outstrips trailing net income by about 9%. And valued on these cash profits, Comcast stock costs less than 9x FCF. Considering that Comcast pays its shareholders a respectable 3.1% dividend yield, it shouldn't take more than about 6% annual growth to make this stock look like a bargain.Thanks to stock buybacks, Comcast actually just grew EPS by 6.5% (and FCF nearly 20%). Were it not for the fact that Comcast carries $90 billion more debt than cash on its balance sheet, I'd probably be calling this stock a buy right now. With the debt, I'm less sure -- but right now, and despite today's sell-off, I'm still leaning toward the buy camp on Comcast stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Comcast right now?Before you buy stock in Comcast, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Comcast wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-unilever-stock-jumped-higher-162642780.html,Why Unilever Stock Jumped Higher on the Market's Down Day,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 12:26 PM EDT","ULVR.L
            +5.67% UL
            +5.93% ","Shares of multinational consumer-goods conglomerate Unilever (NYSE: UL) jumped higher on Thursday even though the S&P 500 was markedly down. The company just reported its latest quarterly financial results, which were full of pleasant surprises. And that's why Unilever stock was up 5% as of 11 a.m. ET today.A modest uptick in consumer demandIn the first quarter of 2024, sales were up a little more than 4% year over year. That's a small increase, to be sure, but small gains are to be expected with a company as big as Unilever. And investors were nevertheless encouraged because the company's sales volume increased by 2.2%.For a mature consumer staples company such as this, there are three usual paths to growth. Companies can increase sales volume or raise prices -- or do both. Unilever mostly grew thanks to volume increases alone in the first quarter, which is the best path of the three.By comparison, many of Unilever's peers are struggling with sales volume right now. For example, Procter & Gamble reported financial results last week, and its sales volume was flat year over year. Investors are encouraged with Unilever's relatively strong results compared to its sector.Performing particularly well for Unilever were products in the beauty and well-being category as well as sales in Latin America. And these strengths pushed financial results higher, exciting investors.A good start to a multiyear planUnilever is at the outset of a multiyear journey to invest in better growth and better profits. And it's taking the task seriously. It's separating its ice cream business into its own company, and it's looking for other ways to boost its profit margins.Unilever stock certainly isn't an investment idea with the highest upside. But its encouraging start to 2024 coupled with its long-term focus on profitable growth are things to consider with the stock trading at an unusually low valuation right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Unilever right now?Before you buy stock in Unilever, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Unilever wasn’t one of them.

            -1.22% ","Wolverine Worldwide has promoted Scott Schoessel to chief marketing officer of its Work Group division.The executive joined the Rockford, Mich.-based footwear company in 2020 as director of digital and retail marketing for Wolverine Worldwide. In 2022, Schoessel was promoted to his most recent role as vice president of global marketing for the Wolverine, Bates and Hytest brands. Prior to joining Wolverine, Schoessel held roles at Limited Brands, Bluedog Design, Gigunda Group, Gatorade and Kellogg’s.More from Footwear NewsDeckers Taps Marco Ellerker as New President of Global MarketplaceMarcelo Burlon Steps Down From County of Milan BrandSchoessel told FN in an interview that his promotion is in line with the footwear company’s efforts to leverage the scale of the Work Group – which includes the Wolverine, Cat, Harley-Davidson, Bates and Hytest brands – and bring the labels closer together across functions.“We’ve begun to pull the brands, at least, functionally closer together to operate with some synergy versus operating as completely distinct brands,” Schoessel said. “And where this has the most impact is with the Wolverine and Cat brands. Because for years, those two brands have been set up as competitors under the same roof, versus taking the opportunity to be able to create a portfolio strategy. So, now as one team we have the opportunity to share ideas, to grow in conjunction or in parallel to each other.”<img alt=""Wolverine, work boot, boots, Reforce, shoes, Wolverine Worldwide"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ga_sGYevO2FkVFaIFixLrw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU3NDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/footwear_news_finance_8/374c1f66a90c7c26021133b9012044af class=caas-img>Wolverine’s ReForce work boot.

And then it’s about assortment control as we move forward. So we will not be necessarily developing assortments individually in silos, we will instead develop assortments with clarity of each brand’s purpose.”<img alt=""Cat, footwear, Intruder, sneaker, work shoe, Wolverine Worldwide"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6vNFezZxrc_PzGNcXzkyDA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU3NDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/footwear_news_finance_8/3a6153948c567074e306aebaacd93eeb class=caas-img>Cat’s Intruder Lightning Mesh sneaker.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chilean-instant-payments-api-startup-162001267.html,Chilean instant payments API startup Fintoc raises $7 million to turn Mexico into its main market,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 2:39 PM EDT","V
            +0.05% ","Open banking may be a global trend, but implementation is fragmented. The fintech startups doing the legwork to make it a reality in smaller markets could become M&A targets for incumbents like Visa.One of these is Y Combinator alum Fintoc, a B2B fintech startup that has raised a $7 million Series A round of funding to consolidate its presence in its home country, Chile, and in Mexico, where it expanded one year ago.Fintoc's product is an API that lets online businesses accept instant payments coming directly from the customer's bank account. Known as accounts to accounts, or A2A, this method offers an alternative to credit card transactions, with fewer intermediaries.For end users, A2A can be as frictionless as an online credit card payment. Instead of entering card details, they can just pick their bank and securely facilitate their bank credentials. But the main selling point is to businesses, which pay a lower commission than the usual credit card transaction fees.Many countries now facilitate A2A, which has created tailwinds for open banking companies such as Plaid, Visa-owned Tink, TrueLayer and Volt. More generalist fintech players like Adyen and Stripe have also closed partnerships to offer A2A payments to their customers.Latin America, however, isn't particularly easy to enter for global players, nor very attractive. It is highly fragmented, and many countries still lag behind in financial inclusion: Fewer than half of Mexican adults have a bank account, according to World Development Indicators.Mexico's low banking penetration is a problem, but also an opportunity for Fintoc, CEO Cristóbal Griffero told TechCrunch. He expects neobanks to address the issue, but it will take time. ""If we are there right before this boom, we'll be able to grow with the market.""Fintoc's home market was less challenging in some ways. This helped it get quite significant traction: ""In 2023, 1,807,000 people paid products, services and bills using Fintoc. This is approximately 13% of Chile's population,"" content manager Pedro Casale wrote in an email. Fintoc says it is used by more than 1.2 million people monthly in Chile.These numbers are even more impressive considering that Fintoc faces competition from other players such as ETpay and Khipu. But its large clients mean that it is tied to frequent use cases such as topping up public transportation cards, making e-commerce purchases, covering bills and paying credit installments.Chile's population size, however, puts a ceiling on Fintoc's potential growth, Griffero said. ""You have the limit that we are 20 million inhabitants, so after a certain amount of revenue, it is very difficult to reach $100 million in ARR. It gets very complicated and you have to go out.""Story continuesThe necessity to expand applies to any Chilean fintech. But Fintoc's roadmap also reflects that the market has considerably changed compared to 2021.Toned-down expansionWhen Griffero and co-founder Lukas Zorich joined Y Combinator's winter 2021 batch, their pitch was pretty straightforward: They were building ""Plaid for LatAm."" That's no longer the case; Plaid's model was too advanced for the region, and the idea to launch all across the region was too ambitious.VCs, too, have come to the same conclusion, as Fintoc learned during its fundraising process, Griffero said.""I believe that the funds are still here, only that their thesis has changed a little. Now you have to explain very well why [you'd go into] each country. Saying ""I am X for LatAm"" is no longer something appealing to investors, especially those in San Francisco, because Latin America is super fragmented and suddenly it doesn't make sense to be in every country. So maybe it's Mexico, Chile and one other country, not Brazil or not Colombia; not ""we are going to do all of Latin America because we are close.""This more measured approach doesn't warrant mega-rounds. ""In 2021 this round would probably have been five times larger,"" Griffero said. But maybe that's for the best; TechCrunch followed more than one unicorn having to scale back on its pan-LatAm expansion and lay off staffers as a result.Food delivery company JOKR confirms closing of Santiago, Medellin operationsFintoc expects a lot from its Mexican expansion. ""Mexico is the market we will most care about in the next two years and we expect it will represent the bulk of Fintoc's revenue within the next two years, Griffero said. But the startup is taking it step by step: Out of its team of 48 employees, only five are based in Mexico. Zorich moved there last year, but Griffero might not do so until next year.With more onerous plans, Fintoc's Series A round may not have happened at all. In the first quarter of the year, fintech funding slowed to its lowest level since 2017, CB Insights reported. In Latin America, it's when compared to Q2 2021 that the drop is most blatant: Fintech startups from the region collectively raised $6 billion across 94 deals then, compared to only $0.4 billion last quarter.Funding LatAm fintech is less en vogue than three years ago. But for VCs willing to wait, the rise of open banking across the region could eventually result in interesting M&As. Not just in Brazil, where Visa shelled out $1 billion for Pismo, a payments infrastructure that will give it access to Pix, the country's ubiquitous instant payment system. In Mexico, too: In 2021, Mastercard acquired fintech startup Arcus, whose co-founder Iñigo Rumayor participated in Fintoc's Series A round.Fintoc's main investors also have connections to its target market. Brazilian fund Monashees, which previously participated in Fintoc's seed round and has now made a follow-on investment, has an office there. And its Series A lead, Propel, is based in the U.S., but was able to facilitate introductions to Mexican banks, an important step for the startup's expansion.""The closer we get to the payment rails, the better payment experience we can offer,"" Griffero said in a statement.Fintech funding slows to the lowest level since 2017On the client side, Fintoc is targeting Mexican businesses that accept offline payment methods such as cash payments and post-pay methods, where customers must visit a physical location to complete their transaction. This makes A2A a pretty clear upgrade; but eventually, Griffero hopes it will also replace debit cards, and later on, offer a solid alternative to credit cards.Mastercard and Visa will clearly face more competition as instant payments become commonplace with systems such as Pix in Brazil, but also UPI and India and FedNow in the U.S. A recent Bain & Company report estimates that 90% of today's payments revenue could ""migrate to software vendors, major technology firms, and other contenders."" This explains some of their past acquisitions, and we wouldn't be surprised if others followed.View comments"

Jim will then provide an update on key milestones for our long-term strategy, which positions us well to deliver growth through the cycle. Following that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim.Story continuesJim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3. In the first quarter, Team Dow delivered sequential volume growth and margin expansion. We strategically increased operating rates to capture improving demand, we maintained pricing and we benefited from lower feedstock and energy costs.These results reflect the strength of our advantaged portfolio, including our participation in diverse end markets and our cost advantage positions around the world. Net sales were $10.8 billion, down 9% versus the year ago period but up 1% sequentially, driven by gains in performance materials and coatings and industrial intermediates and infrastructure. Volume increased 1% year over year. And excluding hydrocarbons and energy, volume increased 5%, with gains in all regions.This marks the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth. Sequentially, volume increased 1% and excluding hydrocarbons and energy, was up 3%, led by gains in performance materials and coatings. Local price decreased 10% year over year and was flat sequentially as modest gains in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, or EMEAI, were offset by declines in Asia Pacific, the United States and Canada. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $674 million, down $34 million year over year driven by lower prices in all regions.Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $115 million, reflecting gains in performance materials and coatings and industrial intermediates and infrastructure. We delivered cash flow from operations of $460 million in the quarter, resulting in a 94% cash flow conversion on a trailing 12-month basis. This reflects our focus on cash flow generation and enabled $693 million in returns to shareholders. We also advanced our long-term strategy with our higher return, highly capital-efficient Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, where construction started earlier this month. Now turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4.In the packaging and specialty plastics segment, operating EBIT was $605 million, down $37 million compared to the year ago period, primarily due to lower integrated margins. Local price declines were primarily driven by lower energy and feedstock costs globally. Volume decreased year over year driven by declines in the hydrocarbons and energy business. This was primarily due to prioritizing higher-value downstream derivative polymer sales as well as lighter feed slate cracking in Europe.Sequentially, operating EBIT decreased by $59 million as improved polyethylene integrated margins were more than offset by expected lower nonrecurring licensing revenue and higher planned maintenance activity. Moving to the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $87 million compared to $123 million in the year ago period. Results were driven by lower prices in both businesses, which were partly offset by three items: lower energy and feedstock costs, improved equity earnings and volume gains in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals.Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $72 million driven by improved equity earnings and lower energy and feedstock costs, primarily in EMEAI. And in the performance materials and coatings segment, operating EBIT was $41 million, up $6 million compared to the year ago period, driven by volume growth and higher operating rates. Volume was up year over year driven by gains primarily in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased $102 million driven by higher seasonal volumes and overall improved demand.Now I'll turn it over to Jeff to review our outlook and actions.Jeff Tate -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Jim and good morning to everyone joining our call today. Turning to our outlook on Slide 5. We are seeing signs of improving macroeconomic conditions in several regions, which gives us cautious optimism heading into what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. That said, we are keeping a close eye on inflation, interest rates and geopolitical tensions.The U.S. is benefiting from improving industrial activity with manufacturing PMI in expansionary territory every month thus far this year. In fact, manufacturing production expanded at its fastest rate in 22 months in March. Average chemical railcar shipments were also up 4.3% year-to-date compared to last year through mid-April.And while high interest rates continue to improve building and construction activity in the U.S., building permits were 1.5% higher in March year over year, while existing home sales declined 3.7% in March. In Europe, consumer spending and industrial activity remain weak with manufacturing PMI decreasing in February and March. This partly reflects ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea, which have led to higher freight costs globally. Declines in inventory levels are a promising indicator with March at the lowest levels since July 2022.Economic activity in China continued to recover steadily with signs of improving demand. Industrial production increased 4.5% year over year in March. Additionally, retail sales grew 3.1% year over year in March, supported by consumer spending around the Lunar New Year. Nonetheless, the property sector remains weak with new home prices continuing to decline through March.Industrial activity in other regions remains constructive. In March, India manufacturing PMI reached its highest level in more than three years at 59.1. ASEAN manufacturing PMI reached an 11-month high at 51.5. And in Mexico, industrial production increased further in February.Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter on Slide 6. In the packaging and specialty plastics segment, higher global polyethylene integrated margins, resilient demand in packaging, as well as continued strength in the export markets are expected to drive a $150 million tailwind in the quarter. Additionally, we expect $25 million in tailwinds from our site in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, which has returned to operations following an unexpected storm in December of 2023. Lastly, we expect a $75 million headwind due to increased plant maintenance primarily in Sabine, Texas.In the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment, consumer durables demand continues to be muted. However, we expect margin expansion on improved MDI and polyols spreads in Europe. We also expect modest seasonal demand improvement in building and construction end markets as well as resilient demand in pharma and energy end markets. Altogether, these represent a $25 million tailwind.In addition, we expect a headwind of $25 million due to planned maintenance in Europe and the U.S. Gulf Coast. This will be partly offset by the completion of a turnaround at a PDH unit in the first quarter. In the performance materials and coatings segment, higher global siloxane prices and seasonal demand increases in building and construction end markets are expected to drive a $75 million tailwind in the second quarter.We also expect an additional $25 million tailwind from a turnaround at our siloxane pillar site in the U.S., while our Deer Park and PDH sites will come back up following planned maintenance in the first quarter. So with all the puts and takes, at a company level, we expect second quarter earnings to be approximately $200 million above first quarter performance. Now moving to Slide 7. As we navigate the cycle and execute on our long-term strategic actions, Dow remains committed to our culture of transparency, accountability and benchmarking.Today, we published the results of our annual benchmarking update, once again demonstrating our strong performance and value creation relative to our peers. The results can be found on our investor website. Dow came in well ahead of pure average and broader S&P 500 with continued attractive three-year average free cash flow and dividend yields. This reflects our commitment to industry-leading cash generation and shareholder remuneration across the economic cycle.Our three-year EBITDA margins and return on invested capital are above the peer median with return on invested capital, 200 basis points above our 13% target across the economic cycle. We also delivered best-in-class net debt reduction since 2019, which allows us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities even at the bottom of the cycle. Our achievements in these areas point to our continued discipline and financial flexibility. As a result, Team Dow has set the stage for us to drive earnings growth and increase shareholder returns through the cycle.With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Jeff. Moving to Slide 8. Dow is well positioned to capture demand and drive earnings growth as the economic recovery takes hold. This is reflected in our competitive advantages and early cycle growth investments which are advancing while also demonstrating Dow's continued focus on operational and financial discipline.And we have a differentiated portfolio with structurally advantaged assets, global scale and low-cost positions in every region. Healthy oil-to-gas spreads, supported by growing natural gas and NGL production in North America, favor our cost advantage and ability to capture continued margin improvements as the economic recovery gathers strength. We've also taken actions to grow Dow's earnings as we execute our near-term, higher-value, lower-risk growth investments that are expected to deliver approximately $2 billion in incremental underlying EBITDA by mid-decade. Since 2021 we have added capacity that will increase our mid-cycle EBITDA by approximately $800 million, including investments in our FCDh unit in Louisiana and alkylation capacity investments in the United States and Europe that serve attractive market segments such as consumer nondurables and pharma.In addition, we have invested in multiple downstream silicone debottlenecks to address fast-growing applications in MobilityScience and electronics. We are on track to achieve the remaining $1.2 billion of our near-term EBITDA target by mid-decade, enabled by our lower risk and higher return growth projects. These investments represent a significant portion of Dow's earnings growth in the next up cycle. Moving to Slide 9.Dow continues to execute with financial and operational discipline as we invest through the bottom of the chemical industry's economic cycle for long-term profitable growth. Our near-term growth and efficiency investments continue to progress with our propylene glycol expansion in Thailand achieving mechanical completion this month. We are also making good progress on our Decarbonize & Grow strategy, including our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. Construction began earlier this month, where we're installing the first of approximately 4,000 piles that will anchor the foundation of our new net zero cracker.In addition, all long lead time equipment items have been ordered, further demonstrating our consistent focus on locking in cost efficiencies for this project. We also entered into a long-term agreement with Pembina, a leading ethane supply and transportation provider, to supply and transport up to 50,000 barrels per day of ethane. With this latest agreement, we have secured the majority of our cost-advantaged ethane supply with multiple suppliers in the region. Overall, I expect the Path2Zero project to deliver an additional $1 billion per year in mid-cycle EBITDA growth at full run rates over the economic cycle.In addition, we continue to advance circularity through our Transform the Waste strategy via strategic partnerships and offtake agreements. This includes a recent joint development agreement with Procter & Gamble, which will create a new recycling technology aimed at converting hard-to-recycle plastic packaging into recycled polyethylene. The result will be near virgin quality and lower greenhouse gas emissions than virgin polyethylene. All in, we expect our Transform the Waste initiatives to generate more than $500 million of incremental run rate EBITDA by 2030.Turning to Slide 10. Our actions since 2019 have created a stronger Dow. Over the past five years, we have worked hard to improve our balance sheet, to improve cash flow conversion and to build a more resilient company that maintains consistent discipline. This was demonstrated when we delivered $12.4 billion in peak EBITDA in 2021, higher than any other time frame in Dow's history.This has created the opportunity for us to invest strategically at the bottom of the cycle for long-term profitable growth. And as implementation of our growth strategy increases our underlying EBITDA, we will continue to target at least 65% of operating net income to shareholders as we move up the next peak. This means at least 45% in dividends and 20% in share buybacks. Closing on Slide 11, I want to thank you for your interest and ownership in Dow.The team and I look forward to engaging with many of you on our 2024 investor day on May 16. As a reminder, the event will be hosted from the New York Stock Exchange. It will also be available via live webcast. More information can be found on our website at investors.dow.com.During the event, we will share progress on Dow's commitment to improve underlying earnings by greater than $3 billion by 2030 that will enable raising the mid-cycle as well as the trough and peak earnings levels. We'll demonstrate our consistent commitment to operational and financial discipline, our capital allocation priorities and our leadership in attractive market verticals. And we'll show how, taken together, this creates significant value creation as we grow earnings and enhance shareholder returns over the cycle. Before I turn it over to Pankaj, he mentioned at the top of the call that we have our incoming vice president of investor relations, Andrew Riker, joining us today.I'd like to take a minute to congratulate Andrew as he takes charge and to thank Pankaj for leading the investor relations team over the last three years and also for his contributions to our upcoming investor day. Pankaj, we look forward to seeing your achievements in your next role leading our Dow Industrial Solutions business. With that, Pankaj, please get us started with the Q&A.Pankaj Gupta -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.Please go ahead.Hassan Ahmed -- Alembic Global -- AnalystGood morning, Jim. Jim, a quick question around global ethylene and polyethylene supply demand fundamentals. On the surface, as I sort of take a look at global utilization rates, they seem relatively slack. But then as one sort of thinks through marginal producer economics, I mean, they seem pretty weak right now and we're obviously hearing more and more announcements of capacity closures, out in Europe.So how do you see utilization rates pan out in '24 and beyond?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Hassan. Good question. I would say, obviously, there are differences around the globe depending on the cost positions. And we have a footprint that is very highly advantaged in North America and Latin America and the Middle East.Europe is right now where you've seen most of the focus on supply reductions with a couple of announcements of crackers being shut down. I'd also say China, there's a lot of pressure on operating rates there because the cash margins are negative and have been negative for some time and there's a big arbitrage window open between the United States and China. And so all of those things have really led to much higher operating rates in the cost-advantaged regions. And even in Europe, where we had LPG cracking flexibility in the first quarter and propane was still a little bit high in first quarter but that advantage led to higher operating rates for us in Europe.Our overall operating rates jumped about 10 percentage points in Europe in the first quarter. So I think if you've got a cost advantage position, things are looking pretty good. Europe is a little bit islanded off right now because of the tensions in the Middle East and the Red Sea effect from shipping. And so it's relying on its domestic production for the market growth and there has been some volume growth there.And the Middle East, that has been focused more on Asian demand. So I feel good about it. All of the -- most of the new capacity is in the market already and we're seeing volume growth, second consecutive quarter of volume growth. And we're starting to see year-over-year volume growth numbers.So it feels like we're starting to turn the quarter a little bit.Questions & Answers:OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.David Begleiter -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystThank you. Good morning. Jim, last quarter, you gave a bit of an earnings walk up to about $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion of EBITDA this year. Do you still believe that number is achievable if not beatable given the solid Q1 results?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, David. I think with the first quarter results and the $200 million that Jeff mentioned on the call, we're right on track. I would add that, as you go into third quarter, now that we'll have another $100 million from the restart of Glycol 2 in Plaquemine, so $100 million third quarter, $100 million fourth quarter kind of numbers. So we're starting to see that run rate and that run rate right in line with what we need to deliver that $6.4 billion.And then I would say the underlying chemical demand, I talked about in last quarter, it felt like destocking slowed. Inventory levels for us in December were lowest they've ever been. They continue to be low at the end of first quarter and chemical production and chemical shipments are up. And so when you look at those numbers, you say this volume growth right now feels like it's demand driven, not restocking driven.And so I think as we start to move up this thing, hopefully, the economy keeps with us here and we start to see us pick up some momentum on this trend.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Vincent Andrews -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThank you, and good morning, everyone. If I could just ask, in the PSP guidance for 2Q and that step up to $150 million, can you just walk us around the world and tell us sort of how you're bridging that $150 million?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Good morning, Vincent. Thank you. And it's mostly a step-up in integrated margins.I think we're looking at about $0.03 a pound globally in integrated margin increase. North America -- Europe may be a little bit more than 3, rest of the world is pretty flat. We've got, obviously, kind of a one-time improvement. We had Bahia Blanca down, as mentioned, in the first quarter -- for part of first quarter to the -- beginning of it because of the storm they had in December.But it's back. And so you'll see a $25 million improvement there. So those two positives are $175 million. We have higher turnaround costs in the quarter.We're doing the turnaround at Sabine this quarter. That's about $75 million. So net-net, you've got about $100 million up in P&SP for the second quarter. And the volume numbers are good.The margin numbers are good. Exports are good out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. Product is flowing.Operating rates are good. So we're starting to see the positive impacts of all those things.OperatorYour next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead.Frank Mitsch -- Fermium Research -- AnalystThank you. And let me also echo my congratulations to Pankaj. Best wishes in Industrial Solutions. Jim, I was wondering if you could talk about operating rates across the Dow portfolio in general.How has that -- that appears to be one of the positives in the quarter. If you could offer some commentary on your expectations for the Dow engine in 2Q and beyond on the operating rate front.Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure. Yeah, happy to do that, Frank. I'd say globally, at a high level, we were at about 6% which is up quarter over quarter. It's -- higher demand obviously drove that, lower energy costs in Europe were a big driver of that as well.The United States Gulf Coast, Argentina, Canada have been running at well north of 80%, some as high as 90% kind of rates. Europe saw the biggest individual step-up, as I mentioned previously but all regions saw a step up in rates. And so I'm optimistic that, that's just a sign of underlying demand coming. So you'd probably think -- I think I mentioned like about 10 percentage points up.That's good ballpark for the whole global number with North America, Latin America being -- continue to be strong and high rates and Europe being a big part of that step up.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.Steve Byrne -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystYes, thank you. I wanted to ask a question about the hydrogen-fueled cracker you're building in Alberta. And then you also have the investments with the Mura pyrolysis feedstock. For those investments, how would you expect the unit costs of those downstream crackers to compare to, say, Texas-9 on a unit cost? And to drive the return on those projects, do you have sales agreements for the product at a premium price?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSteve, on the hydrogen-fueled cracker, we recover part of the higher unit costs there through the price on carbon. And the team is working on as well, trying to get the premium pricing for that offtake. And I would say our view on that is that it will be there. There's a strong demand for low-carbon emission products, ethylene-based materials.And so we're working on that right now. But the returns on that project are going to be equal or greater than Texas-9 all in. And so when you take a look at it, we are very optimistic about where we're going to be with that project. And Texas-9 was one of the projects that obviously led us to be able to deliver the $12.4 billion in peak earnings in that 2021, 2022 time frame.So I feel good about that. Again, remember, because of the scale and because of the fact that we get the hydrogen and methane as byproducts off the back of the cracker, the incremental cost is coming through the autothermal reformer, which, part of that is recovered through the price on carbon. And then we have long-term ITCs, investment tax credits, from Canada for that low carbon investment. Those two things will make it very competitive with Texas-9.On Mura, Mura will be focused on, primarily on looking at the recycle demand, at which the supply for recycled polyethylene right now is much shorter than the demand. And so there are premiums in the market today for those materials. And the Mura process, in our view, is one of the more highly profitable ones because it uses the supercritical steam to change the product back into a monomer state. So we feel good about the start-up of that project.Josh Spector -- UBS -- AnalystYeah. Hi. I was wondering if you could share some thoughts on free cash flow for '24 since you kind of reiterated your expectations there on EBITDA. How do you see that tracking? And any update you can provide on any of the nonoperating items that you thought could bridge free cash flow for this year as well? Thanks.Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJeff, do you want to walk through what you think the free cash flow outlook is for the year? And I would just say, Josh, the one thing we have to remember, as we're turning the corner here, December was the low point from a pricing standpoint and we've seen successive improvements January, February, March. So we go from a use of cash -- a source of cash in the fourth quarter to use of cash in the first quarter. But as we make that turn and earnings improve, we'll start generating the free cash flow out of higher earnings.Jeff Tate -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Well said, Jim. And good morning, Josh. Building on Jim's statement there, the other thing I would mention is that we've also started to see, as the volumes have been improving, we're seeing sales ramp up and we saw the sales ramp up throughout the quarter.So our receivables are also ramping up as well from a working capital standpoint. We're also going into a heavy turnaround period as well, which we anticipated. So all of this is in line with our expectations and our projections, especially for the first half of the year in terms of the working capital uses of cash that we would expect and have. But as Jim mentioned, as we go into the second half of the year, we continue to see the volume growth and the volume ramp-up in the sales leading to earnings growth that will get us into a really good position as we think about our cash flow on a full year basis.And we'll continue to have what we like to call unique to Dow, cash levers. If you look over the past several years, we have had anywhere from $1 billion to almost $3 billion on an annual basis of cash levers that we've identified and executed on. And you can expect that to be very similar in 2024. As we work on our Nova judgment, which we've talked about in the past, we continue to evaluate a number of our nonproduct producing assets that we have across our portfolio as well.And we're going to continue to focus on structural working capital improvements that we can make while also looking at opportunities to get cash out of our joint ventures.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Mike Sison -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystHey, guys. Nice quarter. And congrats, Pankaj, again. In terms of 2Q volumes, will hydrocarbons and energy be a headwind again? And I guess, how much, I'm just curious on sort of the core volume growth for PSP.And then just quickly curious on siloxanes if -- why you think there could be improvement in 2Q versus 1Q? Thank you.Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure. I think on hydrocarbons and energy, I would say, as we went into first quarter because we had -- obviously Bahia had been impacted by the storm and because we had the arbitrage, obviously, to China and wanted to move more product. We elected not to move materials into the broader market and just focus on higher operating rates. So sometimes byproduct sales are not as high off the crackers, especially for cracking light like we were in Europe and in North America.And so that leads to less volume of byproducts to sell. And sometimes, it's running the derivatives harder. As I mentioned, volume was up 5% on derivatives since first quarter and that was just -- we were moving that ethylene through the derivatives and making more product. I expect that will continue.So we might see hydrocarbons and energy be a little bit less but I think you're going to see improved margins on those volumes. And the team is working hard to continue to deliver on the volume growth numbers. We had a very good first quarter result and we've got strong volume as part of that second quarter number plus the higher integrated margins. So I'd say price in China has moved up and demand for the downstream products is good, especially when you think about things like electronics, even continuing into automotive, hybrids and EVs both drive good demand, data centers, chips, thermal management for silicones is big.So the only thing that's a little bit slow is on the construction side. And so you've got higher operating rates in China. You've got better siloxane pricing. We've got personal care markets that are moving into positive territory.So I would say, before we even see a big step up in building and construction, those are already starting to improve.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.Jeff Zekauskas -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- AnalystThanks very much. In your industrial intermediates and infrastructure forecast, you have sales going up sequentially 1% or 2% and you've got your EBITDA flat sequentially. And normally, there's seasonal strength in the various construction markets. Why is your forecast so conservative? And then secondly for Jeff, how many shares will be issued? Or what's the amount of options and shares issued that will affect the share count in 2024?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Good morning, Jeff. I think the biggest thing, when you look from first quarter to second quarter on II&I is because of the Glycol 2 situation in Plaquemine. We had some insurance recoveries in the first quarter that don't recur in the second quarter.So that creates what looks like a bit of a headwind. I think the underlying business is good and the underlying demand is good. If you look at Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals, obviously, we've seen a step up in Europe and in operating rates. Sadara is also doing more of the marketing of some of those materials and so we see a little bit less volume coming through Sadara, from Dow marketing the Sadara offtake.So that has a little bit of an impact. But I would say -- our view is, we're still seeing construction slightly better and we're seeing, obviously, Europe much better cost position and that's driving the improved operating rates and just that insurance delta is probably the biggest thing. Jeff?Jeff Tate -- Chief Financial OfficerJeff, in terms of the issuances for the full year and this then captures options, deferred stock, 401(k) plan as well as Dow employee stock purchase plans. We're looking at approximately 11 million shares on a full year basis.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.Kevin McCarthy -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystYes, thank you and good morning. Jim, I'd like to ask you about your thoughts on the likely pace of capacity rationalization across the global ethylene chain. You mentioned the cash negative margins in China today. Obviously, we've seen some of your competitors announce rationalizations in Europe in recent weeks.So my question would be, relative to prior cycles, do you think we're likely to see more supply come out of the equation this cycle, based on a combination of the current energy regime in Europe and obviously a powerful drive to decarbonize?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi. Good morning, Kevin. Always hard to predict exactly the pace that things are happening. But we've been under pressure on the high-cost assets have been under pressure from a cash cost standpoint for some time.So we're -- it's normal around this time you would start to see retirements. The thing that we should consider when we're looking at our assets likely to be retired, the age of the assets and the older the asset in general, you get a couple of things, those unit costs are not as competitive. It's maintenance costs start to ramp up. And so you have to question putting in big maintenance dollars on top of that asset.And then depending on the environment you're in, CO2 and the emissions off of those assets and what does that do to you longer term because there is a cost in Europe, obviously, for CO2. And if you're not going to abate that, then you have to take long-term decisions about that. So I think that's why Europe has seen the first moves. And obviously, as we've talked about before, there are a lot of policies in Europe that are continuing to drive costs up.So we've seen it not just in petrochemicals but we see it in steel. We see it in other energy-intensive industries. I think we've been fortunate that we are advantaged in Europe because of our ability to crack LPGs and that's helped us tremendously. In China, some of those assets are newer and a lot of state-owned enterprises there.So it may not be at a pace that you would see the changes in Europe. But we just have to keep an eye on that. I think nobody wants to run when you're bleeding the kind of cash that we're talking about, between $100 and $200 a ton. That's pretty ugly territory.So I think you'll continue to see some changes.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Kevin Estok -- Jefferies -- AnalystHey. Good morning. This is Kevin Estok on for Laurence. Just to touch back on silicone trends.I was just wondering if you guys have seen any visibility into restocking in Europe and whether you've seen maybe any green shoots in construction globally. Thank you.Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, I haven't seen big signs of restocking in Europe. I would say on construction trends, we are starting to see some positive things happening. When you take a look at existing home sales, even though some of the year-over-year trends are down, we're starting to see some marginal improvements, building permits are starting to tick up, which is good. So new homes -- there's a need for new homes in North America for sure.And so you're going to start to see that demand. And what the team says to me is that when we start to see interest rate declines, we see a couple of interest rate declines in a row, you tend to start to see a pretty immediate uptick in the downstream demand for products that are in our polyurethanes business, our silicones business or coatings business. So we're watching closely for that. But I feel like this is more underlying demand driven, some of the markets I talked about earlier, electronics, data centers, automotive, anything that has to deal with energy and thermal management.Those have been strong. Personal care is strong. Fair amount goes into infrastructure. Infrastructure is obviously still good.So as soon as we see some pickup in the housing, I think we're going to start to see another step change.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Duffy Fischer -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystYeah, good morning. Just a question around your coatings and monomers business. You had volumes up but when you look at a lot of your big competitors -- or not competitors, customers who have announced already, PPG, Sherwin, EXO, their revenue was all down in Q1. What's your sense for what's happening in the coatings market this year? Are you guys overshipping, do you think, in Q1 for where the demand level for paints will be this year? And then just how do you see pricing trending in that business for you guys?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Good morning, Duffy. I don't think there's any overshipping or stocking going on there. I think, obviously, some customers are more exposed to the contractor business and that's very much driven by new homes and new construction.And then there's the DIY segment. And we're pretty heavily impacted by the DIY segment, so painting existing homes or when existing homes are sold. And so we tend to see that -- that bottom tends to help us. I think, obviously, we had a very strong fourth quarter.We had some turnaround activity in first quarter and still had pretty good numbers. So I think we're well positioned for the peak of the season and second and third quarter. And also some of the monomers demand from time to time can be an added positive on that. And so it doesn't all necessarily mean it's downstream coatings.Some of the monomers going into other markets could help us out a little bit, too.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Mizuho. Please go ahead.John Roberts -- Mizuho Securities -- AnalystAnd congrats as well to both Pankaj and Andrew on the new roles. Jim, there were some reports about European warehouses and ports being jammed again with your customers' products. Do you think there's supply chain inventory building again downstream in Europe?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAny particular products, John, that you're thinking of?John Roberts -- Mizuho Securities -- AnalystJust the economic magazines are talking about because of the Red Sea issues, just a lot of safety stock, I guess, being built up again across some supply chains.Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI see. I haven't seen it in plastics for sure. I don't know if we've seen any of that in polyurethanes or construction chemicals. Our days of inventory are low.I mean, we're at 41 days of sales in inventory, which is one day better than we were in fourth quarter. So I'm certainly not seeing it in our case. And we're pretty focused in Europe on the domestic market. We're not -- we don't rely on Europe as an export hub.So I think that's to our advantage there. The Red Sea, I believe, is going to be the way it is for the next -- for the rest of the year probably. I mean, if things were resolved today, I think it would take about six months for the shipping channels to move back around. So I'll just -- we'll just have to keep an eye on it.It hasn't had an impact on us so far. And we're not exporting out of there. So -- and we're still expecting good operating rates in second quarter.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham from Citigroup. Please go ahead.Patrick Cunningham -- Citi -- AnalystHi. Good morning. You called increased demand in functional polymers for the first time in a few quarters. Can you speak to some of the specific areas of strength or products for which you're seeing increased demand? And you've also called it out as the source of some higher return, high EBITDA contribution, incremental growth projects.How meaningful is that benefit in 2024?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Functional Polymers is going to primarily be driven by infrastructure markets. You think wire and cable is big, automotive is big, golf balls is a big part of it. Footwear sales are improved.So all those areas are very robust. I'd say the power demand, electric -- you hear about it, AI, data centers but just beyond that, the energy transition, electric grids, installations of new, it could be wind, it could be offshore wind, it could be a solar farm, it could be a telecom center, it could be a data center, it could be replacement of wiring in the existing grid. All of that takes the products that we sell and we're the market leader in wire and cable jacketing. So that's been big.And then I think we're kind of set up for year-over-year movements on footwear, which was a little bit slow last year. And then infrastructure also would include things tied to -- imagine membranes for aligning water basins, water treatment basins, membranes for roofing replacement. We do a lot of membranes into cool roofing for building efficiencies. So when you put a new flat roof on a building, you'll see a lot of these very white, light color roofs.We work with our customers who make that material and install those. There's a high demand for that and that's continued and commercial building and retrofits of anything from an energy efficiency standpoint still continues to be high. Solar PV, I should mention, we've got a big new piece of business for solar PV encapsulation. And we put on some of the outer layers that protect the solar panels.And so this is a product that is very durable and long-lasting and it's really picked up over the last couple of years. So those would be the big drivers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Chris Parkinson -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystGreat. Thank you so much. So Jim, there's been a lot of back and forth in the buy and the sell side communities about the $0.03 increase for April and then obviously some preliminary ideas for May. Just, where we stand right here, right now, given the U.S.macro, given where you anticipate USGC operating rates to be on a sequential basis, what's Dow's view of this? We all know what the consensus view is but what's your view in terms of how things play out during the second quarter and how that ultimately sets the tone for the second half? Thank you so much.Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe're moving up in the second quarter. I would say it almost moved up that $0.03 at the end of the first quarter. And the numbers have continued. The macroeconomic indicators have continued to get stronger, not weaker.So I think with the volume that we're seeing on the downstream derivatives with improved economic business and the consumer still being strong, I think you're going to see it move up in the second quarter. So I think we're very firm on the 3 April. And as I mentioned, we started at the low point at the end of December and we just saw steady improvement through the first quarter. And so I think we're off to start the second quarter at a much higher rate and see some momentum as we move through that quarter.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead from Barclays. Please go ahead.Mike Leithead -- Barclays -- AnalystThank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up to an earlier question on cash flow, maybe for Jeff. I guess, if you hit your EBITDA targets for this year, are you forecasting working capital to be a use of cash or a source of cash this year and to roughly what magnitude?Jeff Tate -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Good morning, Mike. Yes, we are actually looking at it still being a use of cash on a full year basis as we work our way through, again, the recovery for a number of the dynamics that I mentioned earlier in relation to Josh's question here. But again, as we see the earnings improve based on the volume improvements that we're anticipating, right, we will start to turn that corner.But coming from where we're coming from on our working capital today, it will be a use of cash on a full year basis.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from RBC Capital -- sorry, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Alex Yefremov -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystThanks and good morning, everyone. I want to come back to silicones. Was the improvement that you saw more on the upstream silicone side or downstream? And as a follow-up, where are your downstream silicones margins relative to your mid-cycle expectations? And therefore, what's the sort of optionality for downstream silicones improvement?Jim Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Aleksey. It's from both. We saw better demand on siloxanes and better pricing and we saw better downstream. We saw improvements in building and infrastructure, which were primarily seasonality driven.We saw gains in personal care. We saw gains in industrial and chemical processing, where some of the products are used as intermediates. We saw gains in mobility and we saw gains in consumer electronics. So all the downstream markets were up.The siloxanes demand was up. The operating rates were up. The pricing on siloxanes were up. So it was pretty balanced on both sides.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Arun Viswanathan -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you guys are well and good working with you, Pankaj, as well. And so I guess my question is, you're on a run rate now of, say, $6.3 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion of annual EBITDA.Do you still think maybe mid-cycle level is around $8 billion? And if that is the case, how do you bridge kind of going from $6.5 billion to $8 billion, is that -- that $1.5 billion, would -- are there any discrete items maybe that you'd call out as far as capacity additions? Or is it mainly going to be volume recovery based? Thanks.Jeff Tate -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Good morning, Arun, I think you're right on top of the run rate. So no comments there. I do think mid-cycle -- I mean, our view of mid-cycle is probably closer to $9 billion.And so to get to that mid-cycle run rate, obviously, we have to have another couple of step-ups to get there. Volume is a big part of it. So as I mentioned, all the projects, on the call that some that we've already put in place that equal $800 million of the step-up and the rest that we're in flight right now, that's another $1.2 billion of step-up. So that $2 billion of improved margins is all volume.And most of that capex is either been or will be finished this year and beginning of next year. So I feel good about that. Obviously, the Path2Zero in Alberta comes later. So I think you can see that $1 billion more toward as we're getting to the next peak.That's a '27 to '29 time frame where that's coming in, '27 is Phase 1, '29 is Phase 2. And so if we've got our timing right and that's what we intended, was we got that up and running before we get into the next peak. And so I think we've got the line of sight to the volume that's going to come from here to mid-cycle. When we get to investor day on May 16, we're going to unpack all that volume and that trajectory.And then we've got the line of sight into the stuff that gets us greater than $3 billion by 2030, which is next peak type economics. And from where we are, that's excellent growth rates for both of them. And so I feel like we've been through the worst of it here on the slowdown in the cycle. And so it should be more upside than downside from here out.OperatorThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Pankaj Gupta for closing remarks.Pankaj Gupta -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThank you, Christa and thanks, everyone, for joining our call and we appreciate your interest in Dow.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-textron-stock-crashed-12-160830961.html,Why Textron Stock Crashed 12% on Thursday,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 12:08 PM EDT","TXT
            -9.69% ","Shares of defense contractor Textron (NYSE: TXT) tumbled 11.8% through 10:35 a.m. ET Thursday despite the company reporting better-than-expected results for Q1 2024.Analysts forecast the maker of armored cars, military drones, Cessna airplanes, and Bell helicopters would earn only $1.13 per share (non-GAAP) on sales of $3.1 billion in Q1. But Textron surprised to the upside with $1.20 per share in earnings and sales of $3.14 billion -- yet its stock fell. Why?Textron Q1 earnings reportThe earnings numbers above are all non-GAAP -- which is to say they don't count costs that the company considers ""one-time"" in nature. When calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Textron's earnings were actually only $1.03 per share, which was less than the non-GAAP number, and may have disappointed investors. Still, it's a respectable 12% improvement over Q1 2023 numbers -- not too shabby considering sales grew less than 4%.Textron grew sales and earnings in three of its four biggest segments (aviation, Bell helicopters, and ""systems,"" the division that builds drones and armored cars). Only the company's industrial division suffered a sales and earnings decline.These weren't the biggest changes at Textron, however. The biggest change was the fact that Textron's share count fell 6% year over year, as the company continued buying back stock. (This also helped drive earnings per share higher, as net profits were divvied up among fewer shares.)Is Textron stock a buy?Clearly, Textron thinks its stock is a buy. Just as clearly, investors today think it's a sell. So who's right?Here's how we find out: At $15.9 billion in market capitalization and $13.8 billion in annual revenue, Textron stock sells for about 1.2 times trailing sales. That's a bit expensive for a defense contractor. The stock also sells for 17 times earnings, which seems aggressive for the 10% long-term growth Textron is expected to produce -- and free cash flow is unimpressive at only 72% of reported earnings.Thus, I have to conclude: Textron stock is more of a sell than a buy today.Should you invest $1,000 in Textron right now?Before you buy stock in Textron, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Textron wasn’t one of them.

Smith shares down 7% as of 11:30 a.m. ET.A lukewarm quarterA.O. Smith is one of the world's largest manufacturers of commercial and residential water heaters and water treatment products. The company earned $1 per share in the first quarter on sales of $978.8 million, a mixed result relative to Wall Street's consensus estimate of a $0.98-per-share profit on $996 million in sales.Lower steel costs helped fuel profitability, and A.O. Smith said it saw strong commercial demand in the U.S. China is also producing sales growth despite ongoing macroeconomic issues in the country.The company reaffirmed its previous guidance for earnings of between $3.90 and $4.15 per share in the quarter on sales of between $3.97 billion and $4.05 billion. That's within range of Wall Street's expectations of $4.08 per share on $4.01 billion in sales. But A.O. Smith said first-quarter shipments did include some pull-forward of demand ahead of a March 1 price increase.Is A.O. Smith a buy following its earnings report?A.O. Smith's global reach is allowing it to benefit both from a energy efficiency-driven replacement cycle in the U.S. and growth in emerging markets including India and China. But China remains a wild card due to geopolitical tensions and concerns about the sustainability of growth, and residential demand remains caught up in the broader housing industry story.All in, it appears likely to be a solid, though not spectacular, year for the company.

If investors must dabble in technology companies they should buy Microsoft Corp., the erstwhile bond king wrote in a post on social-media platform X, in which he also quoted Don McLean’s 1971 hit song “American Pie.”

The suggestions come as tech companies in the S&P 500 Index are on pace for their worst month since September, sliding more than 6.5% in April to drag major benchmarks lower. In contrast, the Vanguard Value ETF — which includes Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and General Motors Co. — has slipped roughly 3.5% over the same stretch.

In the post, which started “The day the music died,” Gross called out that the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries was “moving to 4.75%,” not far above Thursday’s peak of about 4.74%, the highest level this year.

“Why own bonds?” the post reads, noting that Treasury bills yield 5.25%. Gross is the co-founder and former chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co.

Gross said that one of his favorite trades —- pipeline master limited partnerships — have momentum, but investors shouldn’t “overweight too much.”

MLPs trade on exchanges, focus on natural resources like oil and gas and offer higher yields and tax advantages. The investor said he owns Western Midstream Partners LP and MPLX LP, and highlighted their lofty dividends.

The S&P 500 slid as much as 1.6% Thursday after a report showed US economic growth slowed last quarter while inflation jumped, and following underwhelming results from Meta Platforms Inc. Traders also pared expectations for the timing of a Federal Reserve interest-rate reduction, now fully pricing in the first cut in December.

            -7.02% ","Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) delivered mixed first-quarter results and warned of demand softness in the quarters to come. Investors are not impressed, sending shares down as much as 9% on Thursday morning.Slow end markets eat into growthCaterpillar makes the heavy equipment used in construction and mining. It is a great business when times are good for its customers, but big-ticket equipment purchases tend to get deferred when customers are uncertain about their outlook.Caterpillar earned $5.60 per share in the first quarter, beating Wall Street's $5.14-per-share consensus estimate, despite sales that came in about $200 million short of consensus at $15.8 billion.The company was able to offset lower sales volume with strong pricing and a focus on costs. Operating profit margin was 22.3% for the first quarter of 2024, compared with 17.2% for the first quarter of 2023.Things are not expected to get easier in the quarters to come. Management sees second-quarter sales coming in lower than the $17.3 billion it recorded in the period last year and said full-year 2024 revenue should be ""broadly similar"" to the $67.1 billion in sales from 2023.The guidance is in line with expectations, but the lack of growth is still a disappointment. In 2023, Caterpillar grew sales by 13%.Is Caterpillar a buy following its earnings release?Caterpillar is reliant on customers that are cyclical businesses, and there is little the company can do to spark growth during periods where demand softens. But the company remains a cash-generation machine and does a good job deploying that cash to shareholders.In the quarter, Caterpillar repurchased about $4.5 billion worth of shares and paid out $600 million in dividends. Over the past decade, the company has reduced its share count by about 20%.Investors buying in will not get tech-stock-like growth, but they will get a high-quality operator with reliable returns and the potential for upside when market conditions improve. Any weakness here could be a good chance for long-term-focused investors to buy in.Should you invest $1,000 in Caterpillar right now?Before you buy stock in Caterpillar, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Caterpillar wasn’t one of them.

            -8.51% ","Shares of Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) were down 8.3% as of 11:19 a.m. ET on Thursday. The sell-off came after the big drugmaker announced its first-quarter results before the market opened.Bristol Myers Squibb reported Q1 revenue of $11.9 billion, up 5% year over year. The company posted a loss of $5.89 per share based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) compared to a profit of $1.07 per share in the prior-year period. It also announced a non-GAAP loss of $4.40 per share, down from earnings of $2.05 per share in the first quarter of 2023.Why did investors react so negatively to Bristol Myers Squibb's update?The decline in Bristol Myers Squibb's share price today wasn't because of its Q1 numbers. The company's revenue came in above the consensus estimate of nearly $11.5 billion. Analysts also expected Bristol Myers Squibb to post a steeper loss of $4.44 per share.So why did investors react so negatively to Bristol Myers Squibb's update? The drugmaker's guidance was disappointing.Bristol Myers Squibb projects diluted non-GAAP earnings per share for full-year 2024 between $0.40 and $0.70. Its outlook in February was for non-GAAP earnings per share between $7.10 and $7.40. The big downward revision in guidance was primarily due to the company's acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics and a collaboration with SystImmune.Is the big pharma stock a buy?Investors seeking near-term gains will be better off staying on the sidelines in the case of Bristol Myers Squibb. The company faces patent expirations for two of its blockbuster drugs -- Eliquis and Opdivo -- over the next three years. However, with a dividend yield of over 5.3%, Bristol Myers Squibb could be attractive to income investors prepared to hold the stock for the long term.Should you invest $1,000 in Bristol Myers Squibb right now?Before you buy stock in Bristol Myers Squibb, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bristol Myers Squibb wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-2-artificial-intelligence-092900636.html,Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 11:51 AM EDT","NVDA
            +3.71% CRWD
            +0.13% CFLT
            +0.03% ","There's no denying that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on a roll. The chip designer has knocked every earnings report out of the park since OpenAI unveiled the ChatGPT artificial intelligence (AI) tool, powered by the company's AI accelerator chips.Trailing sales are up by 126% in just five quarters. Free cash flow soared 610% higher over the same period, and Nvidia's stock price more than quadrupled.Golf claps and finger snaps aplenty, please. Nvidia has made many investors a lot of money in this AI boom, including yours truly.But this isn't the right time to buy more Nvidia shares. The stock is trading at incredibly lofty valuation ratios as the company's investors bet it will continue to dominate the AI hardware arena for years to come. Since I'm not so sure about that, I recently took some Nvidia profits off the table to reinvest in some lower-priced but equally exciting growth stocks.You may not want to sell Nvidia stock today. In any case, I wouldn't recommend buying more of it right now.Due to Nvidia's inflated share price, I suggest you steer clear of buying this stock until it cools down a bit. But if you insist on buying AI stocks right now, take a closer look at digital design software veteran Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) and semiconductor pioneer Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).Autodesk's AI-driven strategyAutodesk is leaning into the AI opportunity. The company is already a leader in generative AI tools, particularly in the field of professional-quality 3D images.""We can already generate 3D representations from images 10 times faster and with vastly higher quality than currently available 3D AI,"" CEO Andrew Anagnost said in February's fourth-quarter earnings report.To build on this industry-leading expertise, the company is rebuilding its core products around a shared, AI-driven design engine. The master plan is all about product lifecycle management, where a computer-aided design (CAD) can move from one team to another within each client's operating structure without running into red tape and speed bumps. At the same time, software improvements and new features created to serve one target market can easily find use cases across other customers and project types.Again, Autodesk relies on high-quality machine learning and generative AI tools to deliver these planned efficiencies.These are early days in a ""multiyear process,"" and the upgrade path hasn't been smooth so far. Sales are growing but not skyrocketing. Free cash flow is down in recent quarters -- and Autodesk has delayed the filing of year-end financial documents, as auditors found inconsistencies in the fourth-quarter's cash-flow calculations.Story continuesAs a result, investors took a step back from the late paperwork issue, and Autodesk's stock is down 17% in the last month. It trades at 8.6x trailing sales and 36x free cash flow. That's a bargain next to Nvidia, with respective ratios of 33.8 and 76, respectively.Yes, Autodesk is growing slower than Nvidia right now, and I don't love the potentially flawed financial reporting. Still, I'm downright excited about the company's long-term business prospects as the modular, AI-powered software platform evolves.I bought my first Autodesk shares two years ago, as the industry veteran's stock looked undervalued from a long-term perspective. After a few wild swings, the stock price is back where it was in April 2022, but trailing sales are up by 20% and the AI catalyst should add more value over time.Intel's strategic shift toward AI and chipmaking servicesIntel's business model is also transforming. The company is still the leading name in PC and server processors, but Advanced Micro Devices is gaining ground in both markets. On the other hand, Intel taps into the AI boom from several angles, and the recently launched processor manufacturing business doubled its revenue in 2023.This ain't your grandfather's Chipzilla anymore. Some investors aren't comfortable with Intel's shifting strategy, expecting the company to defend its traditional processor business at all costs. But I would much rather own stock in a company willing to change with the times than watch an outdated titan sticking to its old guns. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid doesn't have a happy ending, y'know?The Intel Gaudi 2 may not be the fastest AI accelerator in the world, but AI system builders often don't look for maximum performance per chip. Intel delivers where it counts.""Our Gaudi 2 AI accelerators continue to demonstrate price performance leadership compared to the most popular GPUs,"" CEO Pat Gelsinger said in January's earnings call. ""In a recent blog published by Databricks, Gaudi 2 was shown to clearly deliver the best training and inference performance per dollar based on public cloud pricing.""Moreover, the next-generation Gaudi 3 accelerator will launch later this year with quadruple the processing power and double the networking speed of the current chip.<img alt=""A technician places a silicon wafer in a plastic holder for further processing."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u9_Ws9jq6pCw0IX93ihb3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/4c3f45414ae0525f9e23709d59734a16 class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.The Xeon line of server processors stands front and center in the AI systems market, too, since the supercomputers that train the beefiest large language models (LLMs) use these chips to control each accelerator module's data-crunching activities. Five of the 10 fastest supercomputers in the world today rely on thousands of Intel Xeon processors. The largest one, Argonne National Laboratory's Aurora system, even uses Intel GPUs instead of Nvidia's or AMD's. Those chip sales add up in a hurry when each processor costs at least $11,600.The new and improved Intel is a serious AI competitor, with important side gigs in traditional processor sales and semiconductor manufacturing. Intel is currently consuming cash due to costly upgrades and new construction of chipmaking facilities. But the stock trades at just 2.7x sales, more than 30% below its 52-week highs.Investors looking for a promising AI strategy and a flexible operating model might find Intel an intriguing choice, especially at its current valuation. And that's why I'd much rather buy Intel and Autodesk shares than double down on my Nvidia position right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

            +1.51% ","Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) is cutting back in response to Boeing's issues delivering airplanes, and investors are heading for the exits. Shares of Southwest were down 10% as of 10:30 a.m. ET following the company's disappointing earnings release.Tough choices because of a difficult supplierSouthwest is famously an all-Boeing fleet, relying exclusively on the aerospace giant's workhorse 737 line. Unfortunately, the 737 has had a lot of issues of late. The MAX generation planes were grounded for 18 months in 2019-2020 after a pair of fatal crashes and recent quality issues forced the company to slow production and push back new model certifications.Fewer planes mean slower growth for Southwest. On Tuesday, the company announced it lost $0.36 per share in the quarter on revenue of $6.33 billion. The first quarter is historically a weak one, but the results were worse than the $0.34-per-share loss on sales of $6.42 billion that Wall Street had expected.Southwest said it as cutting service to airports in Houston; Syracuse, New York; Bellingham, Washington; and Cozumel, Mexico, due to a lack of planes and intends to limit hiring. The airline expects to end 2024 with about 2,000 fewer employees than at the end of 2023.""We are focused on controlling what we can control and have already taken swift action to address our financial underperformance and adjust for revised aircraft delivery expectations,"" CEO Bob Jordan said in a statement.Is Southwest a buy following its earnings miss?For decades, Southwest was one of the best growth stories in the airline industry. But those days were largely over even prior to Boeing's issues, as Southwest has evolved into one of the industry titans instead of a disruptor.This remains a well-run airline with an attractive franchise, but with so little clarity coming from Boeing, it is hard to say when these current headwinds will subside.

The -1.8 reading means investors with a bearish view on equities over the next six months just barely outpaced those with a more optimistic view. However, the drop in bullishness has accelerated in recent weeks.It’s worth noting that respondents polled in the survey are mostly split on what’s next for stocks. The percentage of investors with a bearish view was flat at roughly 34%. The skew was driven by an increase in respondents with a neutral view, which rose to 34% from 28%, while those with bullish view fell to the lowest level since November.The rising uncertainty comes as the market deals with slowing US economic growth, stickier than expected inflation and traders betting that interest rate cuts won’t come until the end of 2024 and will be far smaller than the flurry predicted earlier this year. The S&P 500 is down 4.7% since its record close at the end of March, though the benchmark remains up 5% this year.Despite the weakness, data from Interactive Brokers Group Inc. showed clients continued their to snap up shares in tech heavyweights. Retail traders pushed into favorites like Nvidia Corp., Tesla Inc., and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a Tuesday report showed.“In case you were wondering whether ‘buy-the-dip’ remains foremost in our customers’ mindsets, rest assured that it’s still firmly in place,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, wrote in the report.Meanwhile, a separate survey from the National Association of Active Investment Managers, which tracks advisers from 200 firms, shows managers tapered their equity exposure to 63% on average in the week through April 17.

This fueled robust profits, as earnings per share (EPS) surged 114% to $4.71.To put the results into context, analysts' consensus estimates called for revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32, so Meta sailed past expectations with ease.Meta also noted that the number of users of its family of social media sites grew 7% year over year to 3.24 billion, while advertising impressions across its family of apps jumped 20%.That mostly sounds like a cause for celebration, so what caused the stock to plummet? Meta's plans for artificial intelligence (AI) and the associated spending. Meta raised its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its prior outlook of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, ""We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap."" It also said capital spending to support AI will be even higher in 2025.Context mattersSince generative AI burst on the scene last year, the demand to incorporate these advanced algorithms has been off the charts. Meta is one of just a few big tech companies with the resources to create the large language models needed to bring generative AI to life.The company's Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) AI is widely regarded as being among the top AI systems in the world, though CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged, ""We're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.""While many analysts (slightly) reduced their price targets on Meta stock, sentiment was surprisingly upbeat. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill seemed to capture the prevailing mood on Wall Street, saying that investors should ""buy the [Zuckerberg] shopping cart dip.""With Meta stock selling for just 22 times forward earnings, he's not wrong.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

CAROLINE WOODS: I’m Caroline Woods reporting from the New York Stock Exchange - here’s what we’re watching on TheStreet today.

Wall Street is looking ahead to key inflation data out Friday. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge —the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index — measures how much consumers are spending on goods and services.

This will be the final data on inflation before the Federal Reserve makes its next decision on interest rates on May first. Markets are pricing in a 96 percent chance that the central bank holds rates steady.

Meanwhile, shares of Meta (META) fell sharply after the company announced higher than expected spending on artificial intelligence in its first-quarter earnings report. The tech giant said it expects to spend anywhere between $35 and $40 billion in the coming year, up from previous estimates of 30-37 billion, driven heavily by investments in AI.

On an earnings call with investors, CEO Mark Zuckerberg doubled down on AI saying Meta wants to be the leading AI company in the world, adding that the company needs to increase spending meaningfully before expecting to generate revenue in AI.

These comments spooked investors and threatened to wipe almost 163 billion dollars off its market value.

This all comes roughly a week after Meta deployed its AI assistant on Instagram and Facebook. Meta says the tool has been used by tens of millions of users.

That’ll do it for your daily briefing - from the New York Stock Exchange, I’m Caroline Woods with TheStreet.

The selloff wiped out roughly $400 billion in market value from the benchmark at the low.Meta slumped as much as 16%. Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which both report earnings on Thursday afternoon, dropped more than 5%. Amazon.com Inc., whose results are due on April 30, fell nearly 6%.Before its earnings, Meta shares had rallied this year amid heavy spending on artificial intelligence — and investors had been looking for use of the technology to boost results. Instead, the disappointing revenue forecast raised questions about returns on those investments and whether expectations for other Big Tech peers are too high.“The disappointment on the revenue side is overshadowing any optimism about AI,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors. “It’s hard to tell what the benefit will be to users, and while AI could ultimately mean some cost savings down the line, that isn’t visible yet.”For analysts at Lynx Equity Strategies, Meta’s results raised broader questions about the AI trade.“For all of this attention on AI, why isn’t the company able to beat June expectations,” analysts KC Rajkumar and Jahanara Ahmed said. “Is the monetization of gen AI on track with management’s expectations?”Elsewhere in technology, International Business Machines Corp. and software maker ServiceNow Inc. added to the gloom as their shares slumped after their own earnings reports.With the losses Thursday, Meta has erased more than $170 billion in market capitalization. Yet some analysts and investors see this as a buying opportunity.“It’s a weakness that’s interesting to take advantage of,” Fares Hendi, portfolio manager at SG Prevoir said, adding that Meta was on his fund’s watch list. “Potentially, it’s a fall which can create interesting entry points.”Story continues--With assistance from Katrina Compoli, Ryan Vlastelica, Subrat Patnaik and Julien Ponthus.(Updates stock moves throughout.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic BoomtownsCaught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses SidesA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ LenderStudio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount MergerHow North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments"

Revenue from Nasdaq’s data and listing segment, which houses its trading exchanges, was largely flat from a year ago and also fell short of projections.Just 27 companies went public on the exchange in the first three months of this year, down from 40 in the same time last year. Nasdaq’s pipeline of listings to come has also nearly halved to 80 from 147 this time last year. The end of the year is usually the busiest time for initial public offering commitments.Companies remain wary of going public as wars in Ukraine and Israel add to uncertainty around when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, while new data Thursday showed the US economy slowed significantly in the first quarter as consumer and government spending cooled amid a pickup in inflation. Those concerns appear to be outweighing recent successful debuts like Reddit, which is up about 25% since its IPO in March.Nasdaq’s shares slid as much as 5.5% in New York, the most since June last year. They were up nearly 6% this year as of Wednesday’s close.Its Thursday earnings statement notably lacked any commentary on IPOs for the first time since the third quarter of 2022.The exchange operator usually touts its “listings leadership” in the US, but this quarter won just 69% of eligible US listings compared to 91% a year ago.Thursday’s results instead focused on its pivot to steadier and more predictable revenue streams, though the sluggish revival also dampens its ability to sell those products.“The sustained organic growth against a turbulent capital markets backdrop is a testament to the effective competitive position of the company today,” Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said in the statement.Annualized recurring revenue — a measure of subscription sales — grew by 5% excluding recent acquisitions, driven by 12% growth in Nasdaq’s financial crime and regulatory products. The company also raised its full year operating expense guidance to reflect more technology investments.Story continuesOverall trading volume on Nasdaq’s exchanges was flat year-on-year for a second consecutive quarter.“It was not a great result given the top-line misses and we would not be surprised to see the stock under some pressure,” Citigroup analyst Christopher Allen wrote in a note following results.(Updates throughout including pipeline in third paragraph, listing share in paragraph seven, and analyst note in last paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic BoomtownsCaught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses SidesA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ LenderStudio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount MergerBig Junk Food’s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments"

            -5.31% ","Shares of Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) dropped on Thursday after an analyst downgraded their outlook for the stock. Coincidentally, the company released a product update with its popular Hoka brand, but it didn't move the needle. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, Deckers stock was down 7%.A new shoe line didn't encourage investors todayDeckers stock has performed incredibly over the last five years, rising over 400%. The success of its Hoka brand is a big part of this. In its fiscal third quarter of 2024 (which ended in December), Hoka sales surpassed $400 million and accounted for nearly 28% of the company's total sales.This morning, Deckers announced its latest Hoka running shoe line, the Skyward X. It could help the brand keep growing, but that's not what investors are thinking about this morning.Rather, investors are thinking about comments from Bank of America analyst Christopher Nardone. Previously, Nardone recommended buying Deckers stock but now he's shifting his outlook to more neutral, according to StreetInsider. This is causing some investors to rethink their positions.Deckers stock has gone up really fastIn fairness, Deckers stock is up over 60% in just the past year, which is a red-hot performance for a single year. This rapid price appreciation has pushed the price-to-sales valuation of Deckers to over 5. For perspective, it's traded at about half of this valuation over the last five years.<img alt=""DECK PS Ratio Chart"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jy677fDsd6kiv9ixjvEN0A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU4ODtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/c2cc8fad69637d78e3d1c482934e84a4 class=caas-img>DECK PS Ratio ChartDeckers owns shoe brands that are growing in popularity and the business turns a nice profit. But its valuation is reaching historically abnormal levels so there may be some validity in Nardone's more neutral near-term outlook.Longer-term, Deckers' success may be tied to its ability to continue expanding in international markets. Right now, its international business is about half of the size of its domestic business.

            -8.51% ^GSPC
            -0.46% ","Many top healthcare stocks provide investors with long-term stability, promising growth prospects, and in some cases even a dividend.Yet, investors don't appear to be sold on the fact that Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) checks off all those boxes. The business faces some concerning challenges in the near term, but there is hope that it can get back to growing in the long run.For contrarian investors willing to take a chance on the healthcare company, there could be some promising upside, especially given its low valuation. Does Bristol Myers Squibb stock have the potential to make you a millionaire?What has investors so concerned?Bristol Myers Squibb hasn't been winning over many investors of late. In fact, they have been downright bearish; shares of the healthcare company are down 30% in just the past 12 months.It's not hard to see why investors might not be all that thrilled. It has around $37 billion in long-term debt on its books at a time when interest rates are high. It's also staring down the prospect of declining sales from top drugs Eliquis, Opdivo, and Revlimid as they lose patent protection in the years ahead. And in Revlimid's case, it is already facing competition from generics.Revenue fell by 3% last year to just over $45 billion, the second straight year that the top line has declined. The concern is that it could be the start of longer-term trend. And when combined with the high debt load, it doesn't paint a pretty picture for investors or give them much reason to buy shares of the company.Why the stock could be a tempting contrarian investmentThe near-term outlook for Bristol Myers is indeed concerning. But the company isn't standing pat. It's doing what drug companies always do: looking to bring new products to market and work on their pipelines.Within the past year, the company has obtained approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for multiple drugs. In August 2023, regulators approved Reblozyl, a treatment for anemia in people who might require blood transfusions. It's a promising blockbuster drug that could generate $4 billion in sales at its peak.In March, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Breyanzi, a T-cell therapy for relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. This is another promising product, with analysts projecting that its sales could top $2 billion.Bristol Myers has even more in its pipeline, and it projects that by 2029, its new products could contribute up to $25 billion in revenue. In 2023, its new product portfolio generated a fairly modest $3.6 billion, so there's a lot more growth to come for the company in the years ahead.Story continuesBut could the stock be a millionaire-maker?If you're optimistic that Bristol Myers Squibb can get back to growing its business through its new products, there clearly can be a lot of upside from buying the stock today, especially at its reduced price. The shares currently trade at an incredibly cheap forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 7 (based on analyst projections of its future profits). But the big question is just how much profit could you make from the stock in the long run.If you were to invest $10,000, for example, you would need Bristol Myers to jump 100 times its value for it to make you a millionaire. The company's market cap is around $100 billion, which means growing by 100x would put its valuation at approximately $10 trillion.There isn't a trillion-dollar healthcare company today, but in 20 to 30 years, there might be -- and possibly several. The problem I see is that even over a 30-year period, that would require Bristol Myers Squibb stock to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 16.6% -- well above the S&P 500's long-run average of 10% per year. The company would need some fantastic drugs in its portfolio for investors to be that bullish on the stock for that long.Assuming you were to invest $20,000, then you would need a 50x jump to get to $1 million. At that rate, you're looking at a CAGR of 13.9% over a 30-year period, which is still notably higher than the S&P 500.Should you buy Bristol Myers Squibb stock?Ultimately, it doesn't look probable based on where the company is today that Bristol Myers Squibb can be a millionaire-making stock -- unless you invest a significant amount of money. While a lot can change over 30 years, it's hard to make the case that not only can the stock drastically turn things around right now, but that it also will be a vastly superior, market-beating investment for decades.Given its low valuation, Bristol Myers Squibb can be a good stock, but you shouldn't set your expectations too high because the company does face a challenging road ahead.Should you invest $1,000 in Bristol Myers Squibb right now?Before you buy stock in Bristol Myers Squibb, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bristol Myers Squibb wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-millionaire-maker-biotech-stocks-143000558.html,3 Millionaire-Maker Biotech Stocks,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 10:30 AM EDT","IOVA
            -1.45% VKTX
            +5.82% RXRX
            -1.26% ","It's been a tough past three years for biotech stocks. Although the COVID-19 pandemic sparked bullish interest in the industry, this interest has waned since the contagion began winding down. Between late 2021 and now, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is down on the order of 25% versus roughly a breakeven for the board market.As veteran investors can attest, however, the time to go shopping is when quality stocks are discounted. With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown on three biotech stocks you may want to consider scooping up while they're still on sale. Each of them could help you become a millionaire, given enough time and a big-enough up-front investment.Just keep in mind that the biotech industry's above-average potential is matched by its above-average risk. Invest in them accordingly.1. Iovance BiotherapeuticsCancer treatments aren't exactly a new idea, but the approach Iovance Biotherapeutics (NASDAQ: IOVA) is taking to treat this highly varied disease is still relatively unique -- and promising.Iovance's core science is the development of tumor-infiltrating, or TILs. The are just the white blood cells that routinely fight lymphocytes off bodily infections. They also kill faulty cells before they can reproduce and turn into full-blown cancer. Sometimes, though, lymphocytes cells can't quite figure out how to do their job. They need a little help.Enter Iovance Biotherapeutics. Its technology custom-builds white blood cells for each and every cancer patient taking its treatment, which can be used alone or in conjunction with other oncology drugs. To date, this tech has only brought a single therapy called Amtagvi -- or lifileucil -- to the market, finally winning its first approval in February of this year.Although it's only FDA-approved to treat a very narrow sliver of metastatic melanoma patients, it's a start that can be expanded. And it will be. The therapy is in five other clinical trials.This isn't the only drug in Iovance's portfolio. Early last year, the company acquired the rights to a treatment called Proleukin, or aldesleukin, which is an interleukin that's already been approved and even commercialized. Iovance wants it for more than its current and prospective revenue, though. Proleukin also promotes a better response to TIL treatments like Amtagvi's.It's not always been smooth sailing, for the record. Another drug in Iovance's developmental pipeline called LN-145 hit a regulatory snag late last year, temporarily halting one of its trials. It's a reminder that the biotechnology business can often be an all-or-nothing proposition.Story continuesGiven investment research outfit GlobalData's expectation that Amtagvi's annual revenue alone will eventually exceed $800 million, however, the drama and the volatility it creates may well be worth it.2. Recursion PharmaceuticalsRecursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX) is categorized as a biotech company, but the label doesn't do it justice. It would be just as fair to suggest Recursion is a technology company that just so happens to develop drugs. In its own words, ""Our integrated Recursion Operating System creates a closed-loop system combining proprietary in-house data generation and advanced computational tools to generate novel insights to initiate or accelerate therapeutic programs.""In other words, now that the technology is ready for this sort of work, Recursion is using artificial intelligence (AI) to figure out how new drugs can be created and how they might perform. This approach is certainly cheaper, easier, and faster than performing clinical trials based on nothing more than mere hope.And this isn't merely theoretical stuff. Although the bulk of the company's revenue to date stems from collaboration and consultation with more conventional pharmaceutical outfits, it's also got seven clinical trials of its own underway. Three of them are in phase 2 testing, or roughly halfway through the R&D process that leads to -- hopefully -- an eventual approval. Selling access to its drug-discovery platform, as well as selling its own therapies, are both part of the company's future.Like Iovance, Recursion is still in the red, and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. Don't let that deter you too much, though. Research performed by Global Market Insights suggest the AI-powered drug-discovery industry is set to grow at an annualized pace of 30% through 2032.In this vein, Recursion's top line is expected to improve 26% this year before accelerating to a growth pace of nearly 58% next year. This revenue outlook has the analyst community collectively suggesting Recursion Pharmaceuticals shares are already worth $13.00 even without any net profits yet. That's nearly twice the stock's present price.3. Viking TherapeuticsLast but not least, add Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) to your list of potential millionaire-maker biotech stocks.As is the case with Recursion and Iovance, Viking isn't yet profitable. Also like Iovance and Recursion, though, it doesn't seem to matter. Analysts are taking a decidedly strong bullish stance anyway, with 10 out of the 11 analysts following the company rating it a strong buy (while the eleventh just rates it an ordinary buy.) And like Recursion, the current consensus target of $112.26 is nearly twice Viking stock's current price.What's making these professionals so bullish on a seemingly mundane outfit that isn't working on a cure for cancer or finding brand-new ways to develop drugs? That's just it: There's money to be made in the mundane, which are often underserved and underaddressed pharmacological markets. It just takes the right drug.Viking'a specialty is rare metabolic and endocrine disorders. There's no revenue yet. But there's a great deal of promise. Two of its four clinical trials underway are of obesity treatments based on the same GLP-1/GIP-agonist science behind the wildly popular weight-loss drugs Zepbound (from Eli Lilly) and Wegovy (from Novo Nordisk).While it remains to be seen how Viking can meaningfully differentiate VK2735 from market-leading options like Wegovy and Zepbound, the onus is on Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to defend their turf. Viking can win simply by bringing another option to the obesity-treatment arena at a competitive price.This might help make the bullish case: Goldman Sachs believes the worldwide anti-obesity drug market could swell from $6 billion per year now to $100 billion by 2030.Just don't wait too long if you're going to act. Viking Therapeutics believes it will be making an important public update on the development of the oral version of VK2735 within the next several weeks. That could prove quite catalytic for the stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Viking Therapeutics right now?Before you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Viking Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

            +1.51% ","By Shankar Ramakrishnan and Allison Lampert(Reuters) -Boeing's credit rating faced pressure for a second time this week as S&P brought the company one step closer to a junk rating on Thursday after a January mid-air blowout of a cabin panel led the planemaker to slow production of its best-selling jet.The rating agency changed its outlook on the company's bottom of investment grade rating to ""negative"" from ""stable"" to reflect an increased potential for Boeing to face further delays in the expected recovery of its cash flow and credit ratios.S&P, which affirmed Boeing's ""BBB-"" long- and ""A-3"" short-term issuer credit ratings, expects the company will not generate enough free cash flow in 2024 to cover looming debt maturities and has flagged concerns over leadership uncertainty after CEO Dave Calhoun said he would leave by year's end.On Wednesday, Moody's cut Boeing's credit rating to one notch above junk status just hours after the company reported it used $3.93 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter.""This rating change with negative watch just adds to the long list of pressures that Boeing is grappling with,"" said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners, referring to the Moody's downgrade.The planemaker has been under heavy regulatory scrutiny, and has lowered production of its 787 widebody, along with its 737 MAX, after the cabin panel blew off an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 flight in mid-air, forcing an emergency landing.But investors and analysts told Reuters that Boeing is in a position to solve its quality and supply-chain problems and increase production to generate needed cash flow before a more serious downgrade. The planemaker could also tap bond markets to get ahead of more than $12 billion in combined debt coming due in 2025 and 2026.Tony Bancroft, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds which owns shares in Boeing, said the rating agencies might cause some near-term volatility but make a limited impact in the long-term.“I think the general understanding is if they’re able to generate the cash flow, by being able to improve deliveries in the back half of the year with the 737 and 787, they have a pathway to do that.""Risks include supply-chain snags, problems with the 787, or the possibility of the Federal Aviation Administration identifying more issues.“I think it depends upon on how they’re able to perform,” Bancroft said.One portfolio manager of a fund that holds Boeing stock said he thinks the planemaker has one to two years to improve production levels to generate needed cash before the risk of a downgrade to junk status.Story continuesIndeed, even with the threat of a downgrade to junk, credit spreads, or the premium over Treasuries paid by Boeing on its bonds, have not widened dramatically in the last few days, said Matt Woodruff, analyst at CreditSights. Some bonds were quoting about 5-10 basis points wider since last Friday, he added.Woodruff said bond investors are not reacting too negatively partly because of the perception that Boeing ""will bounce back eventually.""One pressure point cited by Moody's on Wednesday is that annual free cash flow would fall short of the looming maturities.Woodruff, like others, expects Boeing to tap the bond markets to raise $5 billion-$10 billion in new bonds to address its near-term cash-flow challenges.“It would make sense for them to capitalize on the current high level of demand for fixed income and tap the more liquid investment-grade investor base to raise capital,” he said.On Wednesday, Boeing's chief financial officer, Brian West, told analysts the company has ""significant market access"" and is continuously evaluating opportunities if it decides to supplement its ""liquidity position.""Boeing referred to additional remarks by West, who said the planemaker is ""committed to managing the balance sheet in a prudent manner.""(Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru and Allison Lampert in MontrealAdditional reporting by Shankar Ramakrishnan in New YorkEditing by Chris Sanders, Chizu Nomiyama and Matthew Lewis)View comments"

""Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.”Revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, rose 16% from the same period last year to $67.59 billion, beating analyst expectations of $66.07 billion, per Bloomberg data.

Jefferies CEO Rich Handler sold $65 million in company stock to buy a luxury yacht.

He's said to be buying a Westport 164 from his friend Tilman Fertitta, a Jefferies client.

Handler said on Wednesday that he wasn't planning any more stock sales.

Jefferies CEO Rich Handler sold $65 million of his stock in the company to buy himself a gift — a luxury yacht.

Handler sold 1.5 million shares, or 7% of his holdings, to purchase a ""personal boat and to pay tax obligations,"" the investment bank said in a Wednesday statement.

""My sale of shares today was a gift to myself and my family, and I do not intend to sell any further shares,"" Handler said in the statement. ""I remain extremely bullish on Jefferies.""

A source told the Financial Times the boat was a Westport 164 yacht and was being purchased from Handler's longtime friend Tilman Fertitta, a Jefferies client.

Fertitta is the billionaire CEO of the hospitality company Landry's and owns the Houston Rockets, an NBA team. The two men jointly own Landcadia Holdings, a blank-check company.

Jefferies said in the statement that Handler, who's been with the bank since 1990, had received about 70% of his pay in the form of company shares. The bank said he'd previously sold shares only for tax purposes and charity.

Jefferies didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Investors often view executives' stock sales as signaling a lack of company confidence, so any sales are carefully messaged.

In October, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he would sell 1 million of his 8.6 million shares, his first sale since becoming CEO in 2006. The filing announcing the planned sale said that Dimon chose to sell the stocks ""for financial diversification and tax-planning purposes"" and that he ""continues to believe the company's prospects are very strong.""

Dimon sold the first of the sets of shares in February for $150 million and sold the remainder earlier this month, pocketing $183 million in total proceeds.

            -0.42% KO
            +0.31% ","One tried-and-true path to great returns as an investor is to buy shares of strong companies that have fallen out of favor on Wall Street. These businesses are often enduring challenges that threaten the next year or two of earnings, but not the wider growth picture. In that way, you expose yourself to short-term paper losses in exchange for impressive gains over many years. In effect, you're being paid to be patient.Of course, many stocks are cheap for reasons that do impair the company's long-term growth prospects. The challenge is to avoid these situations while singling out the truly temporary corporate stumbles. Let's look at a few attractive candidates that fit the bill.1. Coca-ColaCoca-Cola (NYSE: KO) stock missed most of the pandemic-era rally in 2021 and then was left out of the post-pandemic market surge over the past year. As a result, shares of the beverage titan have risen by just 24% in the past five years compared to the 73% increase in the S&P 500 over that time.Yet, Coke remains a formidable business with sales volumes rising along with prices in 2023. Earnings are stellar and profit margin is well above that of rival PepsiCo. The company generates enough cash to pay one of the most stable, longest-running dividends on the market.And its growth prospects are solid as rising demand for waters, energy drinks, and other new niches offset declines in the more traditional soda portfolio.2. Electronic ArtsElectronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) is playing a game that's stacked in its favor. The video game publisher owns a huge collection of intellectual property that spans popular niches like sports and casual games. Steady growth in its audience size (and monetization rates) has helped annual revenue rise to $8 billion from less than $4 billion a decade ago.Games are becoming more profitable as the selling model shifts to more of a software-as-a-service approach. EA is a leader in this arena, with subscription services accounting for 70% of annual sales. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth following the pandemic spike, but savvy investors can look past that volatility toward EA's much brighter potential in 2025 and beyond.3. McDonald'sFears about a recent growth slowdown should have investors salivating at the discounted price of McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) stock. The fast-food chain noted that customer traffic dropped into negative territory at the start of 2024, which is never great news for a restaurant business. Fewer guests means fewer opportunities to sell new menu items or those core sandwiches (like the Big Mac) that have been staples for decades.Story continuesMcDonald's has been through many similar challenges in its years sitting at the top of the fast-food industry. It will emerge from this slump, too, with help from promotions and a deeper push into the drive-thru and home delivery segments.In the meantime, investors can collect its tasty dividend payment and marvel at McDonald's industry-leading profit margin. The chain is aiming to push operating profit toward 50% of sales over the next few years, in fact.4. AppleApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares haven't budged in the past year even as the wider market rallied over 20%. There's no shortage of concerns about this member of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" including sluggish growth in China, flat demand for its hardware products, and relatively weak profitability when compared to rivals like Microsoft.It would be a mistake to bet against the iPhone maker over the long term. It has the biggest installed base in the industry, with 2.2 billion users interacting with its brand through the tech titan's hardware. That's a huge audience it can market to for its next several product launches, whether they're iterative updates or revolutionary entries into new categories.Apple looks cheap at its current valuation sitting below 7 times annual sales. Toss in ample cash generation ($40 billion just this past quarter), and you've got a recipe for crisp investor returns from here.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

            -0.08% ","How To Earn $500 A Month From T-Mobile US Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings ReportT-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is set to release earnings results for its first quarter, after the closing bell on April 25, 2024.Analysts expect the Bellevue, Washington-based company to report quarterly earnings at $1.87 per share, up from $1.58 per share in the year-ago period. T-Mobile US is projected to post revenue of $19.81 billion (roughly the same as the year-earlier quarter, per data from Benzinga Pro).T-Mobile recently announced $163 Million in completed network upgrades for Arkansas.With the recent buzz around T-Mobile US, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends, too. T-Mobile US currently offers an annual dividend yield of 1.58% — a quarterly dividend amount of 65 cents per share ($2.60 a year).So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $378,927 or around 2,308 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $75,851 or around 462 shares.Read This: Jim Cramer Says This Energy Stock Is ‘Terrific,’ Calls Casey’s General Stores A ‘Winner’View more earnings on TMUSTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($2.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $2.60 = 2,308 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $2.60 = 462 shares ($100 per month).Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.TMUS Price Action: Shares of T-Mobile US rose 0.6% to close at $164.18 on Wednesday.Read More: Over $1M Bet On Citi Trends?

            +1.74% ","The stock market is the best tool available to most people when it comes to building lasting wealth. In the past two decades, the S&P 500 returned 546%, including dividends. That gain is hard to dismiss.Unsurprisingly, some individual businesses have fared much better. Take Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). The streaming stock might be one of the best-performing in recent times. It has skyrocketed 46,000% since its initial public offering in 2002, turning a $10,000 initial investment into $4.6 million today.Let's look at Netflix's rise over the past couple decades before figuring out if the stock makes for a smart buying opportunity today.Creating a new entertainment categoryNetflix's early executive team, headed by co-founder Reed Hastings, was convinced early on that the internet was going to revolutionize how people viewed video entertainment. Consequently, they transitioned the business to a DVD-by-mail service to one fully focused on streaming. It also helped that the internet was becoming more prevalent, connectivity speeds were getting faster, and hardware devices were becoming more user-friendly.Netflix rode these infrastructure upgrades to rapid growth. What started as a streaming service in 2007 just in the U.S. has transformed into a truly international operation. Netflix has a presence today in 190 countries and territories. It's successfully ventured into new programming categories, video games, advertising, and live events.After years of strong revenue and subscriber gains, both of which continue to this day, Netflix has become a global media powerhouse. The company generated $35 billion in sales in the past 12 months, and it currently has 270 million members. These figures are up 121% and 94%, respectively, from about five years earlier in calendar 2018. Critics always pointed to the fact that Netflix was burning so much cash as it expanded. To their dismay, this is now a company that generates ridiculous amounts of profit. After reporting an operating margin of 21% last year, the leadership team expects this metric to come in at 25% in 2024.What's more, Netflix produced $8.5 billion in free cash flow (FCF) combined in 2022 and 2023. Estimates call for $6 billion in FCF this year. This financial windfall helps fund ongoing share repurchases.It shouldn't be shocking that Netflix's monster success has resulted in a very crowded streaming industry these days. There are some deep-pocketed competitors, like Apple's Apple TV+, Walt Disney's Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video, as well as numerous subscale service providers. Netflix's first-mover advantage gives it tremendous scale and reach that rivals can't really compete with.Story continuesPlay or pause?Netflix's returns going forward aren't going to resemble the past. That's the reality that prospective investors need to grapple with. The service is largely fully penetrated in its most lucrative market, namely the U.S., where it will have to rely more on price hikes to drive growth.Management points out that there are 500 million smart-TV households in the world (excluding China, where Netflix isn't available). Based on its current subscriber count of 270 million, the business still has potential to add new customers over time. But with much of the low-hanging fruit taken, it's reasonable to assume Netflix's expansion trajectory will slow from the previous decade.To be clear, that doesn't mean this is an unattractive investment opportunity. Netflix is still set to increase revenue by double digits over the next three years, according to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates. Earnings are projected to rise at an even faster rate.If you're bullish on these growth trends, then paying the current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30 seems almost like a no-brainer decision. Just be sure to maintain a long-term time horizon of at least five years.Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

            -10.56% ","(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg is asking investors for patience again. Instead, they’re alarmed.Most Read from BloombergUS Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing HopesMalaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest CityBig Tech Surges in Late Hours on Blowout Earnings: Markets WrapJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in WorldBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll ShowsAfter Meta Platforms Inc. revealed that it will spend billions of dollars more than expected this year — fueled by investments in artificial intelligence — the company’s chief executive officer did his best to soothe Wall Street. But the spending forecast, coupled with slower sales growth than anticipated, sent the shares tumbling as much as 16% in New York on Thursday morning, the biggest drop since October 2022.It was a familiar pitch for Zuckerberg, who has said before that the company’s futuristic technological bets will eventually pay off — and that savvy shareholders should stick around.“Smart investors see that the product is scaling and that there is a clear monetizable opportunity there even before the revenue materializes,” he said during a conference call following Meta’s first-quarter earnings report.The strategic pivot may have caught investors by surprise because it had embraced aggressive cost-cutting in recent quarters to boost profit. Its stock had been up 39% so far this year at market close and was trading near all-time highs for the past month.The company credits AI for some of its recent user growth and advertising success, pointing to improvements within its recommendation algorithms. Meta has been one of the best-performing stocks among its Big Tech peers.The Facebook parent is now plowing ever more resources into artificial intelligence, which requires significant investments in computing power — part of an arms race with rivals from Alphabet Inc. to Microsoft Corp. for supremacy in this fast-developing technology. Zuckerberg warned that the investments would increase “meaningfully” and take a long time to generate returns for the social networking company — perhaps years — but urged them to see the long-term benefits that AI has to offer.Zuckerberg took a similar tack when Meta pivoted toward building the so-called metaverse and other futuristic technologies, like VR headsets and smart glasses. Those endeavors have been pricey. Reality Labs, the division inside Meta that is spearheading these efforts, lost $16 billion in 2023. But Zuckerberg says that advancements the group has made in the past year — especially its success with its AI chatbot and Ray-Ban smart glasses — has given him confidence that further investment is necessary.Story continues“We’ve gotten more optimistic and ambitious on AI,” Zuckerberg said. “We’re at a place where we’ve shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us.”Achieving that vision will be expensive. The Menlo Park, California-based company raised its estimates for costs for the year and now believes capital expenditures will be $35 billion to $40 billion. Earlier, it estimated expenses related to things like servers, AI hardware and data centers would be $30 billion to $37 billion.“We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,” Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said in a statement, referring to 2025.At the same time, the social networking company also projected second-quarter sales of $36.5 billion to $39 billion, with the midrange of that forecast less than analysts’ average estimate.Those metrics overshadowed what was otherwise a solid first quarter, with revenue of $36.5 billion, an increase of more than 27% over the same period a year ago. Profit that more than doubled to $12.4 billion.“For all Meta’s bold AI plans, it can’t afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business — its core advertising activities,” Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note on Wednesday. “That doesn’t mean ignoring AI, but it does mean that spending needs to be targeted and in line with a clear strategic view.”In the previous quarter, Meta announced a $50 billion stock buyback, in addition to the company’s first-ever quarterly dividend. It was an effort to placate investors frustrated by the company’s aggressive spending on technologies that have yet to fully pay off.In recent months, Zuckerberg has made AI a priority, refocusing Meta on the technology after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022, sparking a frenzy of competition and development among the big tech companies. Meta has started inserting AI into every facet of the business, from Instagram and Facebook to its smart glasses.The company announced plans for a new $800 million data center in January, and is also developing its own chips for artificial intelligence services. Meta is also working on several new iterations of its large language model, known as Llama, for powering chatbots and other AI services.Read More: How AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg’s Top PriorityThe company reiterated its broader 2024 spending plans, saying it will shell out $96 billion to $99 billion for the calendar year, up slightly from a low-end target of $94 billion to $99 billion. It previously said that much of that would go toward infrastructure costs in addition to long-term bets on augmented and virtual reality.Meta’s mixed report comes on the same day that President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that would force TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., to sell the popular video service or face a ban in the US. The potential elimination of a major competitor could give a boost to Meta’s advertising business since its short-video offering Reels is a clone of TikTok.Reels now makes up about 50% of the time that people spend on Instagram, Li said on a call with analysts. When asked specifically about the TikTok legislation, she said it was too soon for the company to understand the potential impact.Meta has had a turbulent past few years, with a Covid-era bump in users and activity on the platform during lockdowns followed by a subsequent pullback in advertising in 2022. Meta also gorged on hiring when times were good, leading to some 10,000 job cuts in 2023, a period Zuckerberg dubbed the “year of efficiency.”Those painful moves paved the way for the significant increase in profit the company is seeing now. First-quarter revenue was the highest ever in that period. More people are also returning to Meta’s products.Zuckerberg said the Threads app, similar to the former Twitter and launched last July, now has more than 150 million monthly active users — including Taylor Swift.--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.(Updates with share trading in second paragraph.

            -0.76% PINS
            -0.64% ","While some stocks have responded to the 2024 bull market better than others, an abundance of stocks have followed this rising tide. There's no predicting how long this next bull market will last, although historically speaking, these periods tend to significantly outlast bear markets in average duration.If you're investing in top stocks for the long haul, what the market does in a few weeks, months, or even years won't deter you from building your portfolio in all market conditions. On that note, here are two fantastic growth stocks to consider putting cash into the next time you go shopping for businesses to add to your basket of investments.1. Vertex PharmaceuticalsVertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) has made a habit of developing successful products that address significant patient populations with needs that have historically been unmet by existing medications or treatments. Its cystic fibrosis drug franchise has remained a leader in this multi-billion-dollar segment of the rare disease drug market for years, because Vertex's products are the only ones that treat the root cause of this genetic illness.The company is in the early days of launching Casgevy, the gene-editing therapy it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics. As a one-time potential functional cure for not one but two rare blood disorders, this therapy has significant blockbuster potential over the next several years.Vertex is also working on stem-cell-based therapies for Type 1 diabetes, as well as treatments for rare genetic illnesses like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and APOL1-mediated kidney disease. The company's candidate for APOL1-mediated kidney disease, inaxaplin, just advanced to the phase 3 clinical trial stage.While the launch of Casgevy will take time to manifest in terms of the effect on Vertex's balance sheet, the company is already coming from a position of strength with its existing portfolio. The two most likely next launches will be another cystic fibrosis therapy and a non-opioid drug candidate for acute pain.The cystic fibrosis therapy is a new triple-combination treatment that will widen its market share in this space while catering to new cohorts of patients, as well as those who have stopped taking its medicines previously. That non-opioid drug, suzetrigine, also has serious blockbuster potential for the business. It's being studied to treat various pain ailments, including neuropathic pain.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just granted Vertex's rolling submission for suzetrigine's moderate-to-severe acute pain new drug application, the first in multiple crucial stages toward getting the drug commercialized. A new drug application is used to obtain a license from the FDA to market a particular product for one or more indications.Story continuesConsidering that suzetrigine could pose relief options that current pain management drugs do, but without many of the common side effects or addictive qualities associated with pain drugs, this is one significant part of Vertex's burgeoning pipeline that new and existing investors should watch closely. If approved, suzetrigine also faces a significant addressable market opportunity that includes about 80 million patients worldwide.Vertex brought in profits of $3.6 billion on revenue of $9.9 billion in 2023. The company also closed out the year with cash and investments in the amount of about $14 billion on its balance sheet. This is a fantastic business that looks to have a long runway of growth ahead, and investors may want to take note sooner rather than later.2. PinterestPinterest (NYSE: PINS) has had a bumpy few years following its pandemic highs, but things seem to be getting back on track for the business after this period of volatility. The image-search-and-share platform has become a popular source of inspiration for users around the world.As of the end of 2023, Pinterest had hit an all-time high for its monthly active user base of 498 million individuals globally. That figure was up 11% compared to the end of the prior year.While Pinterest's website and app are free for users, these platforms are actually prime advertising space for brands across a wide range of sectors. The company makes money from running paid ads for businesses ranging from small merchants to large, multinational companies.The videos and images on Pinterest's platform, known as ""pins,"" are often actually ads that direct a user to a product or service that aligns with the theme they were searching for. Not all ""pins"" are shoppable at the moment, but management has made it clear they want this to be the case in the future.Digital ad spending has been in flux in the last few years, particularly as concerns about the global economy have persisted. That trend has affected any company with exposure to ad spend, including Pinterest. Broadly speaking, when you're looking at an investment horizon of five years or more, this shouldn't be too concerning. Pinterest is not only witnessing steady user growth again, but revenue is rising and profitability is improving.The company brought in about $3 billion in revenue in 2023, up 9% from 2022, and adjusted net income of $759 million, a 78% improvement from the year before.While Pinterest wasn't profitable under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the full year, it did turn a GAAP profit of $201 million in the final three months of 2023. Revenue growth was back to double digits in the final quarter as well, up 12% compared to the prior-year period.Pinterest has a lot of room to run as it caters to advertisers across industries, while it already has a loyal, expanding base of users ready to be converted from leads to customers for those advertisers. That's a compelling buying proposition for this business looking forward, and for investors too.Should you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/albemarle-stock-value-opportunity-133600376.html,Is Albemarle Stock a Value Opportunity?,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 9:36 AM EDT","ALB
            -0.25% ","Lithium miner Albemarle (NYSE: ALB) has struggled since hitting an all-time high in 2022, with shares down about 64% since. A primary cause of the decline is likely profit-taking after an intense run-up during the pandemic, but slowing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced expectations for future EV demand are also significant factors.Multiple automakers -- including Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), General Motors (NYSE: GM), Volkswagen (OTC: VWAP.Y), and Jaguar -- have pulled back on plans to electrify their fleets. For Albemarle, which generates 74% of its revenue from the production of lithium compounds used in battery production, this development has turned a long-running tailwind into an unexpected headwind. However, the market is overlooking the company's solid financial performance.Despite reduced demand, Albemarle remains profitableWhile the news and market sentiment are bearish right now, Albemarle has consistently turned a profit and paid a dividend. For 2023, the company reported net income of $1.6 billion, or $13.36 per diluted share. Gross profit declined year over year due to an increase in cost of goods sold. The company reported a $604 million charge due to a reduction in the market price of lithium products. On the positive side, revenue rose by more than $2 billion. Despite slowing demand, Albemarle is growing its top line; any future increases in the market price for lithium products will only boost its margins and profits.From a cash-flow perspective, the company had net cash outflows for 2023. However, it generated positive free cash flow the prior two years. The lithium specialist announced an updated plan to focus on free cash flow, including reducing capital spending and expense management. Albemarle took these actions in response to market changes in the lithium supply chain.New ventures coming on lineDespite slowing electric vehicle sales, Albemarle closed deals with major auto manufacturers in the past year, including Ford and BMW, to provide lithium for battery production. The projects run from 2025 through at least 2030.While lithium products account for 74% of its business, Albemarle has two other revenue streams: specialties, which makes components used in high-voltage cables, airbags, tires, and other products; and the newly formed Ketjen segment. Ketjen produces specialized chemicals that aid in fuel efficiency and pollution reduction, as well as other petroleum refining operations. Both of these other segments have exposure to automobiles of all kinds. While these businesses amount to only about one-quarter of Albemarle's revenue, they provide meaningful diversification from the EV market.Story continuesAlbemarle stock offers compelling valueWith the stock trading at multiyear lows, but the business still earning billions of dollars, Albemarle merits close examination by value-focused investors. Based on 2023 earnings and recent closing prices, shares are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of less than 9. Albemarle currently has a healthy balance sheet, with book value per share of $83 and a price-to-book ratio of 1.37. Taken together, these metrics demonstrate a strong company trading at low prices -- in other words, a textbook value investing opportunity.Albemarle raised its dividend for the 29th consecutive year in 2023. With dividend coverage of more than 8 times, the dividend is safe (and presumably the strong history of increases is, too). Additionally, the company has shown it's aware of the recent changes in the EV and lithium markets and has already adjusted course to maximize cash flow from its established leadership position.With such balance sheet strength, new partnerships on the horizon, and responsive management, Albemarle is a solid value at current prices. Electric vehicles are not going away, but neither are internal combustion engines. Albemarle is poised to profit from sales of both, and recent low prices offer a good opportunity to acquire shares.Should you invest $1,000 in Albemarle right now?Before you buy stock in Albemarle, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Albemarle wasn’t one of them.

            +1.60% ","Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) is coming off a strong year for its interactive content platform. Daily active users hit new highs, and revenue grew 30% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, there remains skepticism around the company's ability to sustain high growth and monetize the content on its free-to-use platform.But this could be a great buying opportunity, according to JPMorgan analyst Cory Carpenter. The analyst upgraded the stock from neutral to overweight and raised his price target from $41 to $48. That price target, usually an estimate of where the stock might trade in the next year or so, is 33% higher than the current share price.Is Roblox stock a buy?The market doesn't want to give Roblox credit for its recent growth streak for a few reasons. First, much of its content is centered around gaming, and the video game industry isn't growing that quickly right now.Second, Roblox has an inconsistent operating history. Its top-line growth slowed amid the broader macroeconomic weakness in 2022, and it doesn't have a record of generating a consistent profit yet.Carpenter sees the market's skepticism as a great opportunity to buy shares in a company with many opportunities to keep growing. He specifically cited Roblox's new revenue streams that it's developing in advertising.The analyst also likes that Roblox is wrapping up a period of heavy spending, which should lead to a period of strong bottom-line growth. Indeed, management is targeting one to three percentage points of margin expansion through 2027.The stock has consistently traded around a price-to-sales ratio of 8 over the last two years, so if Roblox can execute to management's outlook for 20% or better top-line growth through 2027, the stock could indeed hit the analyst's target.Should you invest $1,000 in Roblox right now?Before you buy stock in Roblox, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roblox wasn’t one of them.

            -2.45% KO
            +0.31% ","Pepsi Tops Estimates Despite A Weakened Domestic MarketOn Tuesday, Pepsi Co Inc (NASDAQ: PEP) showed it managed to navigate weaker U.S. demand that was the result of Quaker Oats recalls and backlash to higher prices for its drinks and snacks. But despite delivering better than expected earnings and revenue for its first quarter, Pepsi shares dipped about 2% upon the report as Wall Street watched at other things, such as a struggling domestic market.First quarter highlightsFor the quarter ended on March 23rd, Pepsi reported that revenue grew 2.3% to $18.25 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $18.07 billion. When acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange are put aside, organic revenue rose 2.7%.Pepsi earned a net income attributable to the company of $2.04 billion while adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 also surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $1.52.Volume is still under pressure.Stripping out pricing and currency changes to truly reflect demand, the beverage segment reported flat volume while food division saw its volume decrease 0.5%. Besides higher prices pressuring volume, recalls of Quaker Foods cereals and bars only worsened the problem by denting the organic volume by about 1%. The recall due to potential salmonella contamination was first issued in December, and then it got further widened in January. The production at the plant tied to recalls has already ceased but Pepsi will close it in June. As a result, the North American Quaker Food division’s volume plummeted 22%.The domestic market is struggling the most.North American divisions reported declines across unit. The beverage unit contracted 5%, followed by Frito-Lay’s 2% decline. But, the situation seems brighter outside the U.S. Asia-Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China region reported snacks volume grew 12%, while Europe reported beverage volumes increased 7%, followed by a 2% rise in snack volumes.Pepsi reiterated its full year outlook.For 2024, Pepsi guided for organic revenue growth of at least 4% along with a rise of at least 8% of core constant currency earnings per share.Pepsi continues to fight for market share, along with its rivals like The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO). On Tuesday, Coca Cola unveiled it entered into five-year strategic partnership with no other than Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Together, Coca Cola and Microsoft will work to accelerate cloud and generative AI development. Under the agreement, Coca Cola committed $1.1 billion. Coca Cola will take advantage of the Copilot that Microsoft 365 developed to boost workplace productivity. More importantly, Coca Cola gained the opportunity to use AI solutions that Microsoft is heavily betting on in order to boost innovation across all of its business areas, so Pepsi should watch its back as the famous taste battle is about to expand to new fronts and across new dimensions.Story continuesDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-could-merit-p-500-124818654.html,MicroStrategy Could Merit S&P 500 Inclusion If It Adopts New Accounting Rules: Benchmark,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 8:48 AM EDT","MSTR
            -2.00% ^GSPC
            -0.46% ","MicroStrategy could boost earnings by over $3 billion if it chooses to adopt new standards, the report said.

Benchmark said if the company reports positive earnings it meets the final condition for S&P 500 inclusion.

This would boost MicroStrategy’s valuation as index funds would be forced to buy the stock, the broker said.

MicroStrategy (MSTR) could surprise Wall Street analysts and report better-than-expected earnings if the software company chooses to adopt new accounting standards, a move that means it could qualify for inclusion in America’s most important stock index, the S&P 500, broker Benchmark said in a research report on Thursday.

The company will report results for the first quarter 2024 after the close of markets on April 29.

MicroStrategy’s corporate strategy is partly based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. As of March 19 it held 214,246 bitcoin worth $13.9 billion at current prices. Benchmark notes that since the software company started holding bitcoin on its balance sheet it has recorded $2.27 billion in cumulative impairment losses due to a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule called ASC 350.

The FASB issued new guidance in December last year that allows companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet to measure them at fair value, and record changes in fair value in net income in each reporting period. The new rules become effective as of Jan. 1, 2025, but early adoption of the standard is allowed.

“The impact of doing so on MSTR’s reported earnings per share would be massive: the company in its 2023 10-K report estimated that early adoption would increase its 2024 beginning retained earnings balance by ~$3.1 billion,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote.

Analyst consensus is for MicroStrategy to report a first-quarter 2024 loss per share of $0.55. Benchmark estimates that if the company decides to opt for early adoption of the new standard it could report a gain of more than $300 per share for the quarter.

MicroStrategy currently meets nearly all of the criteria for S&P 500 inclusion, the report said. The company is based in the U.S., its shares are highly liquid, 50% of its outstanding shares are available for trading, and its market cap is greater than $18 billion.

For the index committee to consider a stock for inclusion in the S&P 500 it must also report positive earnings in its most recent quarter. Benchmark notes that MicroStrategy has reported losses in 10 of the past 14 quarters. Early adoption of the new standards means the software company could meet this final criterion.

“Inclusion in the S&P 500 would position MSTR’s stock valuation to receive an ongoing boost from the price-agnostic purchases of its shares resulting from enormous passive inflows,” Palmer wrote.

Still, uncertainty around the tax impact of adopting the FASB’s updated guidance could cause MicroStrategy to hold off on early adoption, the report added

            -6.93% ","The turbulent electric vehicle (EV) sector has provided a lot of up-and-down drama lately for investors, who should be very selective these days. But one they should select, at least according to one analyst, is next-generation battery maker QuantumScape (NYSE: QS). Here's a take on his latest take, if you will.Better battery neededQuantumScape is currently developing a higher-energy-density EV battery than the typical products used today, which in broad terms means one that can provide notably higher driving range per charge.The company's power packs haven't yet made it into the guts of any cars; however, they are progressing. In March, QuantumScape revealed that it has started shipping a prototype of such a battery cell to certain customers.According to the bullish -- if cautious -- analyst, one great advantage QuantumScape has is that it's well-funded and thus isn't under extreme pressure to deliver a revenue-generating product right away.""With over $1 billion in liquidity and improvements to cash burn achieved over the last several quarters, QS has extended its current cash runway into 2026 as the company continues along its commercial scale-up path,"" wrote Jordan Levy of Truist Securities in a new research note.In that analysis, Levy reduced his price target from $8 per share to $6; in his view, downbeat news on the wider EV industry will somewhat limit the upside of the stock for now. Still, even at the reduced target, he expects upside of 12% on the most recent closing share price.QuantumScape has much going for itTo me, QuantumScape seems determined to prove it can fulfill the promise of a better battery for EVs, a product that is greatly needed in the industry.Current range-per-charge figures aren't impressive enough on their own to shift the car-buying public to EVs in great numbers. This company is in front of a spectacular opportunity, and given its low share price and that cash cushion Levy mentioned, I think it's a fine bet to become the Next Big Battery Thing.Should you invest $1,000 in QuantumScape right now?Before you buy stock in QuantumScape, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and QuantumScape wasn’t one of them.

            -1.65% ","There haven't been many success stories as outstanding as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). This business has grown rapidly over the past couple of decades and now dominates multiple sectors, with customers using its products daily.This ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has crushed it for investors, rising 975% in just the past 10 years (as of April 19). Even after this monumental performance, shares trade at a reasonable price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of under 3.2.Before you buy Amazon stock, take the time to learn these three things you might not have known about this business.Up-and-coming revenue driverInvestors know Amazon as an e-commerce and cloud-computing powerhouse. That's certainly the case, as these areas produce the bulk of the company's revenue.But there's an under-the-radar segment that deserves some attention. I'm talking about digital advertising. Amazon displays ads on its popular website, which had 4.3 billion visitors in March, and through the Prime Video streaming service, for example.There are a lot of eyeballs on these two services, creating the perfect monetization opportunity. This allowed Amazon to bring in $14.7 billion of ad revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, almost double the amount in the same three-month period three years ago.The rise of this segment in the recent past is truly remarkable, and it points to how Amazon is able to add adjacent business lines in short order. Amazon has become so successful in the advertising space that only Alphabet and Meta Platforms are ahead of it when it comes to market share in the U.S.Notable competitive strengthsA business doesn't become as dominant as Amazon without developing some powerful competitive strengths along the way. This company has numerous advantages working in its favor.This business generated $575 billion in net sales in 2023. That demonstrates how Amazon benefits from tremendous scale. It sells and ships so many products and produces massive amounts of revenue, so it's able to drive a more efficient logistics network, cutting down delivery costs.Because the main online marketplace, as well as Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS), collect so much data, the company now has another asset working for it. Businesses that can amass massive amounts of data on users and also glean insights from this data are poised to stay ahead of the competition.Perhaps most importantly, Amazon's operations lean on positive feedback loops. For one thing, the marketplace, with its buyers and merchants, possesses network effects. Then there's the interconnection of different services. For example, someone who signs up for Prime to receive fast and free shipping could then start to watch streaming entertainment, which drives ad revenue.Story continuesInvestors should prioritize owning businesses like this that have numerous strengths. In Amazon's case, it's hard to argue that its competitive position is under any serious threat, at least for the foreseeable future.Reaching into new areasAmazon's ascent has been propelled by impressive growth. The business seems to want to enter every industry imaginable, leaning on its customer-centric philosophy.Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017, immediately giving it a huge presence in the gargantuan grocery category. The business is also in the healthcare, consumer electronics, payments, gaming, autonomous driving, and satellite-internet segments.This points to the company's strategy of entering totally different markets to drive growth, which may or may not work out as intended. But this is encouraging for shareholders because it shows that Amazon is not resting on its laurels.Now that you're more familiar with the success of Amazon's ad segment, its numerous competitive strengths, and its expansionary strategy, perhaps it's time you considered buying the stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

            -10.56% TGT
            -0.54% ","Meta Platforms shares tumbled in early Thursday trading, potentially hiving more than $200 billion from its market value, as the Facebook parent cautioned that the cost of AI investments would rise sharply for at least the next two years.The warning, paired with a muted near-term sales outlook and more losses in its Reality Labs division, triggered investor concern that AI investments aren't leading to corresponding revenue gains in the tech space.The Meta move in turn weighed on shares of Big Six peers Microsoft  (MSFT)  and Alphabet  (GOOG) , which report after the close of trading on April 25, as well as Nvidia  (NVDA)  and Amazon  (AMZN) .Meta  (META)  posted impressive first-quarter earnings, with early artificial-intelligence investments helping drive engagement on some of its key platforms, such as Instagram, and powering a 27% increase in overall revenue, which came in at $36.5 billion.The group's bottom line of $4.72 a share was also well above Wall Street forecasts, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg struck a bullish tone during his follow-up call with investors.He also cautioned, however, that Meta would transition from it had called a ""year of efficiency"" to what he deemed a ""multiyear investment cycle,"" which will see big increases in expenses and capital spending before its major AI projects can start generating sales.""As we're scaling [capital expenditures] and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently,"" Zuckerberg told investors. ""But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.""<img alt=""Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is transitioning from a 'year of efficiency' to a 'multiyear investment cycle' focus on AI-related technologies.<p>Drew Angerer&sol;Getty Images</p>"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_SUcmYkD3E_6u24jBfKhlw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thestreet_881/d4492e22e23af28207bc41a21b78e1b3 class=caas-img>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is transitioning from a 'year of efficiency' to a 'multiyear investment cycle' focus on AI-related technologies.Drew Angerer/Getty Images""I think it's worth calling that out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it,"" he added.""We saw this with Reels, Stories as news feed transitioned to mobile and more, and I also expect to see a multiyear investment cycle before we fully scale Meta AI, business AIs and more into the profitable services I expect as well.""Meta reports a muted revenue outlookMeta still said it saw current-quarter revenue rising 18% from a year earlier to between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. But that tally missed Wall Street forecasts by around 1.5%.Coupled with a boost in overall expenses, which were pegged between $96 billion and $99 billion this year, and a capital-spending forecast in the region of $35 billion to $40 billion, and investors' reaction to the newly minted outlook was significant.Story continuesMeta shares were marked 16% lower in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $415.38 each, a move would still leave the stock with a year-to-date gain of around 17.4%.Meta shares once shed $232 billion in a single session, back on Feb. 3 2022, when it warned that privacy changes put in place by Apple  (AAPL)  would hammer its near-term ad sales forecasts.Related: Analysts revise Facebook parent Meta stock price targets before earningsAnalysts, as well, were quick to revamp their Meta price targets and stock ratings on the back of the changing narrative, which also includes difficult year-on-year revenue comparisons and elevated Federal Reserve interest rates.Barclays analyst Ross Sandler, who lowered his Meta price target by $30 to $520 a share, called the group's plans an ""Investment Cycle With No Revenue"" in his Thursday report, while Citigroup's Ronald Josey cut his target by $40 to $590.Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, however, affirmed a buy rating on Meta, even as he trimmed his price target by $55 to $500 a share. The analyst noted that faster stock buybacks could soften the blow of a drop in earnings-per-share estimates over the coming quarters.The median price target on Meta now sits at $535 a share, down from $550 prior to the April 24 after-the-bell earnings report, with a low of $480 from JP Morgan and a high of $570 from RBC Capital Markets.AI investments come with big costsThe key factor in much of the Wall Street commentary was the increase in costs tied to building and monetizing an AI-powered business strategy.""Meta's earnings report reaffirmed that AI is a multiyear investment cycle,"" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson, who lowered his price target on the group by $80 to $475 a share, following last night's update. He affirmed an overweight rating on the stock.""Coupled with tougher comps that are causing revenue to decelerate, we see more concern over 2025 earnings and free cash flow,"" he added.But he said that ""while the investment cycle may remain a near-term overhang, we still see Meta as a normalized 10%+ grower with competitive durability.""More AI Stocks:Analyst unveils eye-popping Palantir stock price target after Oracle dealVeteran analyst delivers blunt warning about Nvidia's stockAnalysts revamp Microsoft stock price target amid OpenAI reportsJMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone agrees, arguing that Meta is ""well positioned to benefit from AI increasing engagement and advertising efficiency"" from its platforms.

            +1.77% TSLA
            +4.97% AMZN
            -1.65% MSFT
            -2.45% ","Robotics is an emerging trend in the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. Technology companies are leveraging robotics to enhance operations related to warehouse logistics, manufacturing, and more.Earlier this year, investment bank Goldman Sachs published a report in which it forecast the addressable market for humanoid robots reaching $38 billion by 2035. The interesting part? A year prior, Goldman had initially forecast a market size of $6 billion.As breakthroughs in AI continue at a fast pace, it's not entirely surprising to see such a dramatic increase in projections for a growing market.Let's break down how businesses are integrating robotics into their operations and assess which opportunities may be best for investors looking for some exposure to this area of the AI realm.What are robotics used for?There are many different use cases for robotics. Some of the most common applications include robots in warehouses and fulfillment centers.However, many companies are aggressively pursuing the technology to disrupt the labor force. In the long run, some businesses believe that robotics can assist or even replace human workers in various settings.For example, humanoid robots can be trained to assist with mundane or administrative tasks such as household chores. These bots could also learn to perform more sophisticated jobs in potentially dangerous environments.<img alt=""A humanoid robot shaking a person&#39;s hand."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I5C9AYy0m2hhqdxbgp8LVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTcxOTtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/134b50689200d669fe82056039623930 class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.What companies are investing in robotics?Two of the earliest pioneers of robotics are e-commerce specialists Alibaba and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Both companies leverage robotics in their warehouses. Essentially, complementing human labor with robots can lead to efficiencies in fulfillment centers. Given the volume of orders that Alibaba and Amazon digest on a daily basis, warehouse automation can lead to significant financial benefits at scale.Another company that is heavily investing in humanoid robotics is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). The company has been open about its ambitions in robotics, and how the technology can enhance its manufacturing capabilities.The long-term plan is to implement Tesla's bots, dubbed Optimus, into the company's factories. Specifically, Tesla is looking to facilitate human workers along the assembly line for its vehicles. Given the use cases explored so far, it's clear that robotics could lead to a major paradigm shift in the labor market.Investors might be keen to know that Tesla is far from the only company investing in humanoid bots. Indeed, earlier this year Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel, and OpenAI each participated in a $675 million funding round for a robotics start-up, called Figure AI.Story continuesInterestingly, this was not OpenAI's first investment in the humanoid robotics space. The ChatGPT developer is also an investor in Norway-based X1, which is developing android bots.Figure AI's mission is to integrate robotics across the $42 trillion labor market, including manual labor environments as well as households and even elder care.Is robotics a good opportunity for you?I think the most prudent way to acquire some exposure to AI robots is to invest in companies that are not overly reliant on the technology. In other words, I'd choose to invest in businesses that are already diversified -- and for whom robotics is simply one aspect of the growth roadmap.Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, and Amazon are all solid examples. In addition to e-commerce, Amazon has a gigantic cloud computing operation and a fast-growing advertising business. Nvidia is primarily a chip and data center business today, but the company is also making impressive strides in enterprise software.Moreover, Microsoft's ecosystem spans personal computing, cloud infrastructure, gaming, social media, and more. Lastly, Tesla is a leader in electric vehicles (EVs) and green energy services.I think each of those companies offers investors a variety of growth opportunities, many of which will touch AI in the long run. I see robotics as an intriguing aspect of the overall artificial intelligence narrative. However, the technology itself is still early in its development.While I think the long-term potential of robotics could be massive, it's still a relatively speculative investment. Instead, exploring opportunities in the broader AI space may be the optimal strategy to invest in robotics, while also gaining exposure to other growth areas beyond the technology.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

            -0.12% MSFT
            -2.45% ","Most investors know the potential benefits of leaving their winning stocks alone. While stocks can only fall to zero, there's no hard ceiling on how high a stock can climb. The growth in a long-term winner can often dwarf losses elsewhere in a portfolio.Billionaire investor Warren Buffett put it well in 2023 in a letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: ""The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders"" for your returns.It therefore makes sense to look at the universe of highly successful stocks as fertile ground for your next stock buy. Among those rallying investments with plenty of room to run, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) belong near the top of your watch list.Software is kingMicrosoft is already the biggest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks -- and the world's largest public company -- but the tech giant could continue its remarkable growth streak over the next few decades. Consider just the enterprise software services segment that's anchored by its Azure platform. Microsoft has a strong foothold in this niche, with sales expanding 28% in the most recent quarter. That's better than the results Amazon achieved in the same period with its AWS platform.Both companies are poised to capitalize on the trend of more businesses migrating their digital operations onto the cloud over the next several decades. And thanks to switching costs and efficiencies of scale, this is an example of where winners like Microsoft can just keep on winning. Look for Azure contracts to keep growing in length and in the size of their annual revenue commitments. It's a highly profitable business, too, as you can tell from Microsoft's blazing 44% profit margin.Wall Street is bullish about the company in the short term, with most Wall Street pros looking for sales to rise 15% when the software giant reports its fiscal 2024 Q3 earnings in late April. That would be a 15% increase for a company that already generated a record $227 billion in trailing-12-month revenues. More growth in cloud services, in addition to other areas like cybersecurity, video games, and consumer tech, will pave the way for Microsoft to set sales records well past 2030.Joining the clubThe retail world is a famously difficult industry if you're aiming for sustainable profit growth, but Costco isn't your average retailer. The warehouse giant earns most of its profits from membership fees rather than through volatile merchandise sales. Costco's membership income arrives with incredible regularity since a record 92% of its members are renewing their annual commitments these days. That success should make it easy for the chain to (potentially) raise its fees in the near future, which it hasn't done since 2017.Story continuesThe chart of its earnings growth over the years shows off the power of its membership-centric selling approach. Costco has boosted its annual profits by 240% in the past decade, with no significant downturns. Contrast that with Walmart and Target, both of which have seen weaker growth and much more volatility over that time.<img alt=""COST Net Income (TTM) Chart"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QON7w3Nxl3Oq.M.xkL2PTA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY3MjtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/813ef5cee46c55ae6b7824d6cf755848 class=caas-img>COST Net Income (TTM) ChartCostco's stock isn't cheap right now. Its premium is roughly double what you'd pay for either Walmart or Target, in fact. That's the advantage of looking out several decades for your investing thesis, though. In several years, you might not remember that you bought Costco or Microsoft at premium valuations compared to their less successful peers. But you'll likely be thrilled to have had these winners in your portfolio while they added to their already impressive market share positions.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-global-first-quarter-profit-120536588.html,S&P Global first-quarter profit beats estimates on strong product demand,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 8:05 AM EDT",,"(Reuters) - S&P Global on Thursday beat Street estimates for its first-quarter profit, as hopes of a ""soft landing"" spurred investors to spend more on data and analytics products

With growing expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve avoiding a recession, investors are increasingly spending more on analytics and data-related products. This trend bodes well for companies like S&P Global who provide such offerings.

Revenue from S&P's Ratings segment, which provides credit ratings, research and analytics to investors, jumped 29% to $1.06 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. It helped the company post its record quarterly revenue of $3.49 billion.

The company reported an adjusted diluted profit of $4.01 per share for the three months ended March 31, compared with analysts' expectations of $3.66 per share.

The New York-based firm also raised its full-year revenue growth as well as adjusted profit forecast on growing optimism of a rebound in the economy and increased confidence in strong demand for its services.

The company now forecasts a full-year adjusted profit of $13.85 to $14.10 per share, compared with its earlier expectations of $13.75 to $14.00 per share.

It expects its revenue growth for 2024 to be between 6% to 8%, compared with 5.5% to 7.5% it forecast earlier.

            +0.31% ^GSPC
            -0.46% ","With its popular drinks being sold in 200 countries across the world, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is without a doubt one of the strongest and most widely recognized brands on Earth. The business has been around since the late 1800s, showcasing just how durable demand is over long periods of time.The average investor might have their eyes on this beverage stock because Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway is a large shareholder. The Oracle of Omaha's track record speaks for itself.But is Coca-Cola a no-brainer dividend stock for you to buy below $65? Let's take a closer look.Dominating the industryIn 2023, the business raked in $45.8 billion in revenue. It has 46% market share in the non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink (NARTD) category in the U.S., well ahead of smaller rival PepsiCo.There's no question that the key ingredient to Coca-Cola's success is the brand. Consumers can get soft drinks from an unlimited number of companies, but this one has been around for such a long time, consistently delivering for its end users and their cravings. A powerful brand that resonates with consumers leads to tremendous loyalty.This results in steady demand throughout economic booms and downturns. Revenue held up well throughout the Great Recession. I believe that shows that even when times get tough, people will still buy these beverages.Investors should appreciate Coca-Cola's ability to register consistent profitability. Its gross margin and operating margin have averaged a phenomenal 60% and 26%, respectively, in the past decade.The business generates tons of free cash flow, to the tune of $9.7 billion in 2023. Even after investing in capital expenditures, there are a lot of resources left to fund dividends. The current 3.2% yield is healthy. But even more impressive, Coca-Cola has increased its annual dividend payout in 62 straight years.I see no reason to believe this trend won't continue. Investors who care most about generating income from their investment can do a lot worse than buy Coca-Cola shares.Can the stock beat the market?It's a different story for those investors who are trying to identify stocks that can outperform the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite Index over the long term. If this describes you, you should think twice.Yes, Coca-Cola shares trade below $65, and they are 9% off of their all-time high. However, there are two important reasons why I believe this stock doesn't make for a smart investment for those seeking high returns. One factor to consider is Coca-Cola's growth potential. In the past 10 years, revenue has basically remained flat. And according to Wall Street consensus-analyst estimates, the business will generate $51 billion in sales in 2026, representing just a 10% increase compared to 2023.Story continuesThis points to just how mature the NARTD category is. I'd suspect this industry's revenues won't increase much faster than GDP or population growth. As a scaled operator with a presence all over the globe, this leaves almost no sizable expansion opportunities for Coca-Cola.On its own, limited growth prospects might not be enough of a reason to completely pass on the stock. But what about the valuation?Investors are being asked to pay a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.3 to buy shares right now. That's below their trailing-five-year average. However, it represents a premium to the broader S&P 500. It doesn't seem like a smart move to pay a steep valuation for this business. Even including dividends, the stock has severely underperformed the broader index since April 2019. I expect this to continue.Investors who want to beat the market shouldn't buy shares. But again, income investors might want to take a closer look at Coca-Cola.Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.
