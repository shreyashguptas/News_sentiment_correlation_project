https://www.thestreet.com/investing/analyst-revises-google-parent-alphabets-stock-price-target-before-earnings,Analyst revises Google parent Alphabet's stock price target before earnings,"Mon, Apr 22, 2024, 4:45 PM CDT",GOOG,"Company 'making tough decisions'

Last year, Google Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat announced that she would be stepping down from Alphabet's top finance chief role to eventually assume a dual role of chief investment officer and president.

She became Google's CFO in 2015 and oversaw the transition into the company’s current Alphabet structure. More recently, Porat told the company’s finance teams that their groups would see restructuring, including relocations and layoffs, CNBC reported last week.

“The tech sector is in the midst of a tremendous platform shift with Al,” Porat wrote in the memo, obtained by CNBC, sent to finance employees. 

“As a company, this means we have the opportunity to make more helpful products for billions of users and provide faster solutions to our customers, but it also means we collectively have to make tough decisions, including how and where we work to align with our highest priority areas,” she said. The restructuring will affect finance teams domestically and abroad, including in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

KeyBanc analysts noted Porat's career move when they raised their price target on Alphabet to $175 from $165 while keeping an overweight rating on shares. 

Alphabet has near-term catalysts forming from multiple events: operating expense discipline, the Waymo expansion, a potential dividend, and a new CFO, the firm said.

In contrast, the analysts noted that Facebook parent Meta Platforms  (META)  ""having a wide revenue guidance range around unrest in the Middle East could alarm investors, particularly if the first quarter’s outperformance moderates.""

Meta is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 24 and KeyBanc cut its price target on the social media titan to $555 from $575 while maintaining a buy rating. 

Analyst sees more Google layoffs 

The firm said that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai's April 18 blog post entitled ""Building for our AI future"", signaled that the company is more focused on product velocity, and is taking actions to restructure divisions. ""We believe this is congruent with our view of layoffs persisting through 2Q and speaks to further operating income upside,"" Keybanc said. The analysts said Meta Platforms, an AI rival to Alphabet, continues to show progress with AI, from the expansion of Meta Assistant to the release of Llama 3, the latest iteration in Meta’s series of large language models.

During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January, Pichai told analysts that Alphabet has “led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from search to ads to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already.”

""We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances,"" he said. ""Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams."" KeyBanc analysts believe Alphabet's capital expenditures could reach $42 billion this year and $46 billion in 2025 as it continues to invest in AI technical infrastructure.

Regarding dividends, the analysts noted that Meta surprised investors by implementing a dividend policy during its fourth-quarter earnings call.

""Our sense is investors would like to see Alphabet follow Meta's lead as it represents a good use of cash and does not carry the headaches of M&A,"" KeyBanck said. ""While we believe the likelihood of a dividend has gone up, we believe it's hard to predict whether Alphabet will pursue this before or after a new CEO is chosen.""

On April 17, Truist Securities analysts boosted their price target for Alphabet to $170 from $158 per share, while holding on to their buy rating.

Truist said the adjustment reflected a positive outlook based on sustained user engagement and advertising revenue growth, particularly in Search and Social platforms.

The firm anticipates that Alphabet's first-quarter results will surpass consensus estimates, citing cost management as a key factor in driving year-over-year margin improvement."

It was a gamechanger when OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in late 2022, and Microsoft, with a 49% stake in the company, had a lot to do with that development. Microsoft already uses OpenAI in many of its products.

But Microsoft isn’t finished yet – not by a long shot. It’s building a new AI hub in London that is expected to  “drive pioneering work to advance state-of-the-art language models and their supporting infrastructure, and to create world-class tooling for foundation models.”

And here’s something else to consider: Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says that generative AI is giving Microsoft an “iPhone moment.” Think about that for a moment. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) changed the world when it unveiled the iPhone which was the first mass-marketed smartphone. And it changed the trajectory of Apple stock for decades.

If generative AI is truly Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” the Microsoft could be seeing a long period of sustained growth.

MSFT stock is up 43% in the last year. It gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader."

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-crash-proof-stocks-buy-120000211.html,5 Crash-Proof Stocks to Buy Immediately,"Mon, Apr 22, 2024, 6:20 AM EDT",KO,"Shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stagnated last year over concerns that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could cut into its business. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) U.S. CEO John Furner noted at the time that customers were already buying “less units, slightly less calories,” and that sent a chill through the snack food and beverage industry.

Coca-Cola has since traded at a significant discount to its long-term value, with the stock hovering at just 21 times forward earnings (compared to a five-year average of 23.4x).

That now makes it a particularly strong stock to ride any downturn. In an update at InvestorPlace.com this week, Rich Duprey also notes that cheap share prices now mean Coca-Cola sports a 3.3% dividend yield – well above its long-term average. (Share prices and dividends move in opposite directions, assuming no change in dividend payments). Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) alone is set to receive $775.6 million from this soda king.

Meanwhile, the panic over weight-loss drugs has begun to subside. Wall Street analysts have now nudged Coke’s 2025 earnings estimates back to where they started last year – a typically bullish sign. As Duprey notes:

Coke tends to be an all-weather stock. Cans of soda and other beverages are indulgences consumers will enjoy regardless of economic conditions. This is why it continues to thrive, and Buffett will likely never sell his holdings.

Though Coca-Cola has somewhat limited upside, its conservative nature and reasonable dividends makes it an excellent company to buy as market jitters continue to set in."

Tesla declined to say when the cheap EV will debut, though Musk did say the company would talk more about these vehicles on Aug. 8, the day the robotaxi will be revealed.""These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up,"" Tesla said in the release.Despite reporting a revenue and earnings miss, investors cheered the much-needed update on the EV maker's current and future prospects. Tesla stock has still lost 34% so far this year.Tesla reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.45, below the $0.52 estimated, on revenue of $21.30 billion, which missed forecasts for $22.3 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Revenue fell 9% from a year ago, Tesla's first drop in four years.Tesla reported $1.2 billion in operating profit in the first quarter and $1.5 billion in adjusted net income. Both numbers were short of forecasts and down more than 50% from a year ago. In terms of delivery guidance, Tesla said it still sees ""notably lower volume,"" echoing what the company said in its Q4 earnings report.In its shareholder letter, Tesla also showed preview images of a ridehailing feature in its app showing how a Tesla robotaxi could work.<img alt=""Tesla&#39;s preview of the ride-hailing feature coming to Tesla&#39;s App."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/b8QCifohFr5nH8ebskaYrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUwNjtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/a2244d00-01ae-11ef-bcfd-ddb05b1e5a72 class=caas-img>Tesla's preview of the ride-hailing feature coming to Tesla's App. (Tesla)Prior to Tesla's Q1 report, shares had been hit hard this year after the company reported Q4 results that disappointed, issued weak and non-specific 2024 delivery guidance, missed on Q1 deliveries, and did not refute reports of the demise of a sub-$30,000 volume EV.The revenue drop and profitability slide follow a weaker-than-expected quarter of sales for Tesla.In Q1, Tesla reported 386,810 global deliveries, well below estimates of 449,080, and produced 433,371 vehicles, also below estimates of 452,976. Tesla did note in the first quarter report that Cybertruck production hit 1000 units a week in April.Story continuesThe difference of around 46,500 vehicles produced versus sold led to concerns of demand waning globally for Tesla vehicles, which in turn has led to round after round of price cuts. On Monday, Tesla cut prices for vehicles in the US and China, leading to weakness in the stock during the day.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13214098/embed?auto=1></iframe>Nonetheless, Tesla confirmed that the long-awaited next-generation platform would underpin a sub-$30,000 mainstream EV ‚Äî dubbed the Model 2. That's a huge deal for investors, many of whom see the low-cost EV as a volume play for Tesla.Tesla said upcoming vehicles, including the affordable models, would use aspects of the next-gen platform as well as existing platforms, allowing them to be built on the same assembly lines as current vehicles. The ""purpose-built robotaxi,"" on the other hand, will use the revolutionary ""unboxed"" production line to be made, Tesla said.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ:META) is scheduled to post earnings results for its first quarter, after the closing bell on Wednesday.Analysts expect the Menlo Park, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at $4.32 per share, up from $2.20 per share in the year-ago period. Meta is projected to report quarterly revenue of $36.16 billion, up from $28.64 billion in the same quarter last year, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Meta has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in six straight quarters.On April 22, Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson maintained Meta Platforms with an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $575 to $555, while JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone reiterated the stock with a Market Outperform and maintained a $550 price target.With the recent buzz around Meta Platforms, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Meta Platforms has a dividend yield of 0.40%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 50 cents a share ($2.00 a year).To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Meta Platforms, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).Next, we take this amount and divide it by Meta's $2.00 dividend: $6,000 / $2.00 ¬†= 3,000 sharesSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,488,300 worth of Meta Platforms, or 3,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.00 = 600 shares, or $297,660 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.View more earnings on METAAlso Read: Investor Sentiment Improves Further, Dow Jumps Over 250 PointsNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.Story continuesMETA Price Action: Shares of Meta Platforms rose 3% to close at $496.10 on Tuesday.Read More: Tesla, Boeing And 3 Stocks To Watch Heading Into WednesdayPhoto: Shutterstock""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com¬© 2024 Benzinga.com.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-visa-stock-popped-morning-181603808.html,Why Visa Stock Popped This Morning,"Wed, Apr 24, 2024, 1:16 PM CDT",V,"Shares of credit card giant Visa (NYSE: V) jumped more than 3% in early trading this morning after reporting (apparently) stronger than expected fiscal Q2 2024 earnings -- and much better than expected revenue.

Heading into the quarter, analysts forecast Visa would earn $2.29 per share on $8.1 billion in revenue. In fact, Visa earned $2.51 per share on $8.8 billion in sales. Investors' enthusiasm for the news is, however, moderating as the day wears on. As of 12:20 p.m. ET, Visa stock has retraced to just a 1% gain.

Visa's Q2 earnings report

There may be some confusion about what analysts predicted Visa would earn, and what it actually did earn. Visa noted that its earnings as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) were actually $2.29 on the nose -- exactly what analysts predicted. The $2.51 per share earnings, it turns out, was only Visa's non-GAAP profit, which adjusts for what the company considers ""one-time items.""

That quibble aside, however, there's no debate that Visa trounced analyst revenue predictions. Revenue for the quarter was definitely $8.8 billion, a 10% increase year over year. And GAAP profits were up even more -- 12%.

Is Visa stock a buy?

Visa seems to think these are buyable numbers. Over the course of the quarter, it bought back $2.7 billion worth of its own stock. Unfortunately for investors, Visa paid an average of $280.80 per share for these buybacks -- more money than the stock is worth today.

Was that a mistake?

Perhaps. In its post-earnings conference call, Visa mentioned that it hopes to grow earnings again in the ""low double-digits,"" as The Fly reports. Assuming this translates to another 12% growth quarter -- or even the 13% or so long-term growth rate that Wall Street has Visa pegged for -- the stock looks expensive to me at a P/E ratio of nearly 32, and a PEG ratio of at least 2.4.

While I wouldn't call Visa stock a sell necessarily, it doesn't look like a compelling buy either.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reasons-buy-disney-stock-144500890.html,5 Reasons to Buy Disney Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,"Wed, Apr 24, 2024, 9:45 AM CDT",DIS,"It's been a good year for Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) investors. The stock hit a 52-week high after its blowout financial update in February. The shares have pulled back lately, but with a 26% year-to-date gain, it's easily trouncing the market averages.It's a welcome break. The media giant's shares have lost to the S&P 500 in each of three previous years. There are some good reasons to expect the streak to turn positive this year. Let's go over some of the reasons the House of Mouse could be a smart investment right now.1. Disney+ is no longer a negativeIt was a hot start to Disney+ after the late-2019 launch that helped drive the shares to an all-time high in early 2021. It's the massive losses for the premium streaming service that have weighed on the shares since then. Disney's direct-to-consumer segment -- the business that includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ -- posted a whopping $4 billion operating deficit in fiscal 2022. Its health is improving dramatically on that front.The segment's $138 million operating loss in the first fiscal quarter of 2024 is a lot better than the $984 million deficit it checked in with a year earlier. CEO Bob Iger expects Disney+ to be profitable by the September quarter of this year. Bundling, higher prices for ad-free tiers, and a new thriving ad-supported plan for Disney+ have helped boost the top line. Disney's cost cuts have helped at the other end.<img alt=""Celebrities taking a selfie with a Disney princess."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eiXsb6SoXiwPUry8yM7fUw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/c6757cd79abc6cc7ae872c0fed2eb19b class=caas-img>Image source: Disney.2. Get ready to bounce back at the box officeIt's been a quiet start this year at the local multiplex for Disney, but unlike last year's disappointing showing, 2024's softness is by design. Disney doesn't have any of the 24 highest-grossing domestic theatrical releases this year. Its only notable film this year has been The First Omen, which has cleared a pedestrian $18 million in admissions since premiering earlier this month.All of this is about to change. There is a potential blockbuster coming out nearly every month through the end of this calendar year.May 10: Kingdom of the Planet of the ApesJune 14: Inside Out 2July 26: Deadpool & WolverineAug. 16:¬†Alien: RomulusOct. 18: A Real PainNov. 27: Moana 2Dec. 20: Mufasa: The Lion KingThey won't all be nine-figure winners. They don't need to be. Disney just needs a couple of films in its 2024 slate to succeed to make investors forget about Disney's disappointing 2023 performance at the box office.3. Disney believes in DisneyPositioning itself for success in the proxy battle that ended in Disney's favor three weeks ago, the entertainment leader did a lot of things to make itself more appealing to shareholders and even opposing activists. One thing the board did earlier this year was authorize up to $3 billion in share repurchases. This is Disney's first buyback in six years.Story continuesThe stock may not seem conventionally cheap. It's trading for 26 times this year's Wall Street profit target and 22 times next year's analyst forecast. However, Disney has now posted three consecutive quarters of accelerating earnings beats. Put another way, Disney is increasing its lead over the lowballing analysts shrinking in its rearview mirror. This is a great time to repurchase your shares, boosting your per-share profitability in the process.4. It's spending money while saving someDisney is getting prudent with its costs, even beyond the push to make Disney+ profitable within the next five months. It turned heads a year ago when it announced plans to achieve $5.5 billion in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2024. Now it expects to exceed $7.5 billion. However, it's still willing to spend where it matters.Disney recently announced a $1.5 billion investment in Fortnite creator Epic Games. A knock on Disney 30 years ago was that it was primarily a player in family entertainment. It didn't offer much for families with older kids. In 1996, it acquired the media mogul that owned both ABC and a majority stake in ESPN. It has gone on to snap up Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox, producing some of Hollywood's biggest movies over the past few years. Why wouldn't it want a strategic stake in a gaming company for which 85% of players are under 35?Despite the cutbacks, Disney also didn't have a problem announcing a few months ago that it would be doubling its investment to $60 million over the next 10 years for its theme parks, cruise lines, and other experiences. This has been Disney's most resilient business, and one that requires theme park updates and bar-raising ships to keep drawing guests at higher price points.5. The improvements are everywhereThe weak spots in Disney's armor are starting to get patched up. Bears love to gnaw away at the cost-heavy ESPN, but that business just posted a surprising operating profit in Disney's latest report. Its legacy networks business should get an ad boost this year as political spot spending sees a surge heading into the November elections.It's not just ESPN that's learning how to win the big game. Disney+ posted a 9% increase in average monthly revenue per paid account in its latest quarter. Disney not only reinstated its dividend late last year but also increased the rate of its semiannual payouts by 50% for the next distribution.Disney surprised analysts earlier this year in a rare case of offering guidance. With the contested annual shareholder meeting weeks away, it's probably not a coincidence that Disney was chattier than usual in its February earnings call, but it had something impressive to say. Disney expects its annual adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2024 to climb at least 20%, to $4.60 or better. Wall Street pros were perched at $4.27 a share at the time, and even now, the consensus remains at $4.40 a share.The upside for the leading media stock is hiding in plain sight. Now's the time to buy Disney stock like there's no tomorrow -- or Tomorrowland.Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Walt Disney wasn‚Äôt one of them.

The bank‚Äôs US Tactical Positioning Monitor, which measures clients‚Äô exposure to American equities, hit a level that reflects an ‚Äúattractive set-up‚Äù for the S&P 500 Index, according to a note Wednesday from a team led by Andrew Tyler, JPMorgan‚Äôs head of US market intelligence. The stock gauge has historically gained around 3% in the subsequent 20 days after a similar four-week change in positioning, compared to a roughly 1% gain in all periods, according to the note.

US stocks are up so far this week as solid corporate results lifted the S&P 500. The index is coming off a three-week slide spurred by worries that interest rates will remain elevated for months to come. The focus this week is on technology behemoths, with results from Meta Platforms Inc. due after the close Wednesday and Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. on deck Thursday. Friday brings the latest reading of a key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and investors will be looking for signs price pressures are cooling.

‚ÄúThe tactical bounce appears poised to continue with the keys being megacap tech earnings and PCE releases this week,‚Äù Tyler wrote. ‚ÄúShould all of these hit, you may see markets overshoot to the upside but feels like buy-the-dip has kicked in.‚Äù

He said the current setup is akin to that of August and October, when US stocks also staged subsequent comebacks.

Earlier this week, the bank‚Äôs chief market strategist, Marko Kolanovic, said in a note to clients that the selloff in stocks isn‚Äôt over yet as macroeconomic risks mount, including rising bond yields and elevated oil prices.

While it‚Äôs not unusual for firms to have different views under one roof, the disconnect at JPMorgan has popped up since last year. In August, for example, the trading desk team called for all-time highs on the S&P 500 at a time when Kolanovic was sticking to a bearish stance. Kolanovic represents JPMorgan‚Äôs house view.

He put in $12,000 at the time and then another $50,000 in 2022. His total stake is now worth $3 million.His fortune, which remains mostly invested and untouched, was a matter of research and good timing, he said.""They were the original creators of the GPUs,"" he said. ""I'm not even much of a techie. I'm not a computer person at all, but I knew that the GPUs would be worth something one day.""Nvidia went from a gaming icon to an AI superpower seemingly overnight. In the early days of the pandemic, its stock climbed as gamers, with time on their hands under COVID-19 lockdowns, scrambled to upgrade their computer rigs with the latest Nvidia GPUs.Then, in November 2022, the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT fueled a run of stunning growth for Nvidia as its GPUs were the only game in town when it came to powering such AI programs. The stock has essentially gone parabolic since.According to Vanda Research, Nvidia has become the top stock among retail investors, surpassing retail portfolio concentrations of Apple, Tesla, and SPY, the most popular S&P 500 exchange-traded fund.Tom said his Nvidia stake was worth about three times what he had in his 401(k) and that he felt more comfortable that he'd be able to live well in retirement, a concern that loomed over him before he went in on Nvidia.Generational wealthKiana Danial is the 40-year-old founder of Invest Diva, a company that helps women take control of their financial future and create generational wealth.Story continuesDanial hadn't heard of Nvidia before 2015, when she married her husband, who was a gamer in his free time. Danial said she liked to invest in products she uses, but when she heard her husband talk about how much he loved Nvidia, she decided to buy the stock.She first bought Nvidia in June 2016. She purchased 10 shares and shortly after continued setting new buy orders every month.""The investments started growing pretty rapidly,"" Danial said.Nvidia shares tumbled by more than 30% in 2018.

The stock caught his eye because, at the time, the company seemed like the future of gaming. He invested $600, which he described as a wild-card bet.""And so $600 turned into $140K,"" Rick said.With Nvidia, Rick said he felt he had a safety net to fall back on. He's spent only a small portion of his gains so far: $15,000 to flip a car he worked on, a hobby he said he wouldn't have gotten into without the Nvidia money. For his 10th anniversary, he and his wife packed their bags for a $14,000 getaway in Costa Rica.""I had zero stress about it. It was like, 'We can spend as much as we want on this trip,'"" he said.That sense of security that such a windfall provides was the top theme among the Nvidia investors BI connected with.It's a similar story for Chris Downs, a 66-year-old who lives in rural Missouri and retired from his job as a math teacher three years ago.He's been investing for a while, but his interest in Nvidia began when he bought a new computer for video editing at the start of the COVID-19 quarantines. Downs said he splurged on an Nvidia graphics card for his setup and was impressed.He bought 112 shares in March 2020 for $79 each.In July 2023, he sold 28 shares of Nvidia at $436 apiece to offset losses from other investments. Now he has 84 shares left, worth over $65,000 based on Monday's prices, in addition to other stocks.He said he would probably sell some of his Nvidia shares closer to the election, but he's planning to invest the proceeds for his four children, as his parents and grandparents had done for their kids.Downs said his lifestyle wasn't lavish but that he tried to travel every month. Places he's been to include Bolivia, Paris, and Mexico City, and he plans to go to Spain at the end of April.He said security was the biggest perk of his investment, as well as knowing that he could cover unpredictable financial mishaps.""It's nice in retirement not to have to worry,"" Downs said.Read the original article on Business InsiderView comments"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-things-might-not-know-123000134.html,"3 Things You Might Not Know About This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock","Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 8:30 AM EDT",AMZN,"There haven't been many success stories as outstanding as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). This business has grown rapidly over the past couple of decades and now dominates multiple sectors, with customers using its products daily.This ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has crushed it for investors, rising 975% in just the past 10 years (as of April 19). Even after this monumental performance, shares trade at a reasonable price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of under 3.2.Before you buy Amazon stock, take the time to learn these three things you might not have known about this business.Up-and-coming revenue driverInvestors know Amazon as an e-commerce and cloud-computing powerhouse. That's certainly the case, as these areas produce the bulk of the company's revenue.But there's an under-the-radar segment that deserves some attention. I'm talking about digital advertising. Amazon displays ads on its popular website, which had 4.3 billion visitors in March, and through the Prime Video streaming service, for example.There are a lot of eyeballs on these two services, creating the perfect monetization opportunity. This allowed Amazon to bring in $14.7 billion of ad revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, almost double the amount in the same three-month period three years ago.The rise of this segment in the recent past is truly remarkable, and it points to how Amazon is able to add adjacent business lines in short order. Amazon has become so successful in the advertising space that only Alphabet and Meta Platforms are ahead of it when it comes to market share in the U.S.Notable competitive strengthsA business doesn't become as dominant as Amazon without developing some powerful competitive strengths along the way. This company has numerous advantages working in its favor.This business generated $575 billion in net sales in 2023. That demonstrates how Amazon benefits from tremendous scale. It sells and ships so many products and produces massive amounts of revenue, so it's able to drive a more efficient logistics network, cutting down delivery costs.Because the main online marketplace, as well as Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS), collect so much data, the company now has another asset working for it. Businesses that can amass massive amounts of data on users and also glean insights from this data are poised to stay ahead of the competition.Perhaps most importantly, Amazon's operations lean on positive feedback loops. For one thing, the marketplace, with its buyers and merchants, possesses network effects. Then there's the interconnection of different services. For example, someone who signs up for Prime to receive fast and free shipping could then start to watch streaming entertainment, which drives ad revenue.Story continuesInvestors should prioritize owning businesses like this that have numerous strengths. In Amazon's case, it's hard to argue that its competitive position is under any serious threat, at least for the foreseeable future.Reaching into new areasAmazon's ascent has been propelled by impressive growth. The business seems to want to enter every industry imaginable, leaning on its customer-centric philosophy.Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017, immediately giving it a huge presence in the gargantuan grocery category. The business is also in the healthcare, consumer electronics, payments, gaming, autonomous driving, and satellite-internet segments.This points to the company's strategy of entering totally different markets to drive growth, which may or may not work out as intended. But this is encouraging for shareholders because it shows that Amazon is not resting on its laurels.Now that you're more familiar with the success of Amazon's ad segment, its numerous competitive strengths, and its expansionary strategy, perhaps it's time you considered buying the stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Amazon wasn‚Äôt one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/500-4-absurdly-cheap-stocks-141500619.html,Have $500? 4 Absurdly Cheap Stocks Long-Term Investors Should Buy Right Now,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 10:15 AM EDT",AAPL,"One tried-and-true path to great returns as an investor is to buy shares of strong companies that have fallen out of favor on Wall Street. These businesses are often enduring challenges that threaten the next year or two of earnings, but not the wider growth picture. In that way, you expose yourself to short-term paper losses in exchange for impressive gains over many years. In effect, you're being paid to be patient.Of course, many stocks are cheap for reasons that do impair the company's long-term growth prospects. The challenge is to avoid these situations while singling out the truly temporary corporate stumbles. Let's look at a few attractive candidates that fit the bill.1. Coca-ColaCoca-Cola (NYSE: KO) stock missed most of the pandemic-era rally in 2021 and then was left out of the post-pandemic market surge over the past year. As a result, shares of the beverage titan have risen by just 24% in the past five years compared to the 73% increase in the S&P 500 over that time.Yet, Coke remains a formidable business with sales volumes rising along with prices in 2023. Earnings are stellar and profit margin is well above that of rival PepsiCo. The company generates enough cash to pay one of the most stable, longest-running dividends on the market.And its growth prospects are solid as rising demand for waters, energy drinks, and other new niches offset declines in the more traditional soda portfolio.2. Electronic ArtsElectronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) is playing a game that's stacked in its favor. The video game publisher owns a huge collection of intellectual property that spans popular niches like sports and casual games. Steady growth in its audience size (and monetization rates) has helped annual revenue rise to $8 billion from less than $4 billion a decade ago.Games are becoming more profitable as the selling model shifts to more of a software-as-a-service approach. EA is a leader in this arena, with subscription services accounting for 70% of annual sales. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth following the pandemic spike, but savvy investors can look past that volatility toward EA's much brighter potential in 2025 and beyond.3. McDonald'sFears about a recent growth slowdown should have investors salivating at the discounted price of McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) stock. The fast-food chain noted that customer traffic dropped into negative territory at the start of 2024, which is never great news for a restaurant business. Fewer guests means fewer opportunities to sell new menu items or those core sandwiches (like the Big Mac) that have been staples for decades.Story continuesMcDonald's has been through many similar challenges in its years sitting at the top of the fast-food industry. It will emerge from this slump, too, with help from promotions and a deeper push into the drive-thru and home delivery segments.In the meantime, investors can collect its tasty dividend payment and marvel at McDonald's industry-leading profit margin. The chain is aiming to push operating profit toward 50% of sales over the next few years, in fact.4. AppleApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares haven't budged in the past year even as the wider market rallied over 20%. There's no shortage of concerns about this member of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" including sluggish growth in China, flat demand for its hardware products, and relatively weak profitability when compared to rivals like Microsoft.It would be a mistake to bet against the iPhone maker over the long term. It has the biggest installed base in the industry, with 2.2 billion users interacting with its brand through the tech titan's hardware. That's a huge audience it can market to for its next several product launches, whether they're iterative updates or revolutionary entries into new categories.Apple looks cheap at its current valuation sitting below 7 times annual sales. Toss in ample cash generation ($40 billion just this past quarter), and you've got a recipe for crisp investor returns from here.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Apple wasn‚Äôt one of them.

""Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.‚ÄùRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, rose 16% from the same period last year to $67.59 billion, beating analyst expectations of $66.07 billion, per Bloomberg data. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 versus consensus estimates of $1.53.In artificial intelligence, Google has widely been seen as playing catch up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT.But Google executives emphasized during the earnings call Thursday that the company is well positioned to lead the shift to an AI-centric tech world, and that it is committed to investments that will fuel the development of new models.Pichai said the company has clear paths to monetize AI breakthroughs through advertising, cloud, and subscriptions.He also touted the integration of AI tools into Google search, which allows users to ask more complex and descriptive questions.But how AI will influence Google‚Äôs search business remains unclear, since new AI-based interfaces might displace traditional search and change the way users interact with the Web.Investors are also wary of the costs associated with AI versus the return. Alphabet's report arrived a day after its advertising rival and Big Tech peer Meta (META) noted that expenses for the year are growing and that it will take some time before AI investments generate significant revenue. The comments helped send Meta shares tumbling more than 10%.Alphabet reported capital expenditures for the quarter of $12 billion, mostly tied to servers and data centers. CFO Ruth Porat said during the call that the quarters ahead will register similar levels of spending, which reflects the company‚Äôs confidence in its AI investments.For the second straight quarter, cloud revenue rose nearly 30% from the year-earlier period to surpass $9 billion.Story continuesGoogle has been working to claim additional share of the cloud market, where it currently sits in third place behind rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft.Ad revenue, the heart of Google‚Äôs business, rose by 13%, registering $61.66 billion.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.With that as a backdrop, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) slumped 3.4%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.To be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and what it means for other big players in the AI space.<img alt=""An angry person with hands outstretched looking at a computer monitor."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JLV0BYPllEC.aw92n5Hyew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/60203c5dc29495f50d8ac00aeaf5decc class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.You have to spend money to make moneyMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.The company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.The results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.Like its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, ""there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,"" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.Meta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, ""We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.""As a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, ""We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap."" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.Story continuesUnited in the pursuit of AISo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.Company-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:UBS analyst Stephen Ju maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock, but raised his price target to $215, which suggests 22% upside compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees potential for improvement in a broad cross-section of Amazon's business interests this year. This follows two price target increases by other analysts yesterday.Chinese hackers accessed U.S. government emails last year, something Microsoft could have prevented, according to a report by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has lost face and is working to rebuild trust in its systems, according to numerous reports.The potential for a TikTok ban, which was signed into law today by President Biden, could benefit Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, according to a report in The Washington Post.Investors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs¬†Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.<img alt=""MSFT Chart"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8WQQPZdqXYj2MSTL_6hjzw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTcxNztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/447455c50dafff1be4894f579f50d320 class=caas-img>MSFT ChartWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-investor-ron-baron-says-235519778.html,Billionaire investor Ron Baron says Tesla stock has bottomed out and will 'go up huge' on the promise of more affordable vehicles,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 7:55 PM EDT",TSLA,"Ron Baron once told Elon Musk to stop tweeting.Associated Press via Business Wire

Billionaire investor Ron Baron told CNBC that Tesla is ""going to go up huge.""

The stock has reached bottom after investors were unsure if the firm was scrapping plans for a low-cost model.

Baron sees all cars being EVs in 10 to 15 years, and cited Tesla's cost efficiency compared to rivals.

Tesla's stock has reached a positive inflection point and will leave recent lows in the dust now that the company is giving investors what they want, according to billionaire investor Ron Baron.

""Oh, it's going to go up huge,"" he told CNBC on Wednesday. ""Now is the bottom.""

So far this year, Tesla shares have crashed more than 34%, driven downwards by a first-quarter delivery slag, reports of a pivot towards robotaxis, and a string of leadership controversies.

But to the Baron Capital founder, eroding sentiment had less to do with how the electric vehicle maker performed, but whether CEO Elon Musk was still committed to coming through on promised projects.

""When I think about the reasons the stock is down, it's because people were concerned that he was going to abandon the idea of having a low-cost car and go all into robotaxis,"" Baron said.

Doubts first crept in after a Reuters article announced that Tesla was scrapping such plans, a report Musk then went on to deny.

But now, the company's recent earnings call made clear that it would accelerate production of a more affordable model, and would also unveil its robotaxi later this year. Baron expects the firm to make 5 million of the new low-cost vehicle.

He also cited that Tesla could make a profit by eventually selling its full-self driving technology to other carmakers.

While Tesla's earnings also showed a 9% slump in first-quarter revenue, its stock has jumped close to 18% since then.

Before Tuesday's results were published, some analysts have cited long-term burdens that will continue weighing on the company, including an EV recession and rising competition, whether domestically or in offshore markets.

But Baron doubled down that Tesla continues to have a lead, pointing out the firm's cost efficiency. In his view, all cars will also be electric in 10 to 15 years, and hybrids ‚Äî popular among rivals ‚Äî won't last.

Meanwhile, China's rising BYD competitor is the only profitable firm in the country, he said, and still does not make as much as Tesla.

Tesla is the biggest holding in the Baron Partners Fund, CNBC said. Previously, Baron disclosed that he has made nearly 20 times its Tesla investment since buying the stock a decade prior.

As of 10:52 a.m. ET, the stock was still down 12.3%.The catalyst that sent the social media titan lower was the company's quarterly financial report, but not for the reasons you might think.AI spending spreeIn the first quarter, Meta reported revenue that grew 27% year over year to $36.4 billion. Expenses grew more slowly, increasing just 6%, which helped drive operating margins to 38%, up from 25% in the prior-year quarter. This fueled robust profits, as earnings per share (EPS) surged 114% to $4.71.To put the results into context, analysts' consensus estimates called for revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32, so Meta sailed past expectations with ease.Meta also noted that the number of users of its family of social media sites grew 7% year over year to 3.24 billion, while advertising impressions across its family of apps jumped 20%.That mostly sounds like a cause for celebration, so what caused the stock to plummet? Meta's plans for artificial intelligence (AI) and the associated spending. Meta raised its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its prior outlook of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, ""We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap."" It also said capital spending to support AI will be even higher in 2025.Context mattersSince generative AI burst on the scene last year, the demand to incorporate these advanced algorithms has been off the charts. Meta is one of just a few big tech companies with the resources to create the large language models needed to bring generative AI to life.The company's Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) AI is widely regarded as being among the top AI systems in the world, though CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged, ""We're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.""While many analysts (slightly) reduced their price targets on Meta stock, sentiment was surprisingly upbeat.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chilean-instant-payments-api-startup-162001267.html,Chilean instant payments API startup Fintoc raises $7 million to turn Mexico into its main market,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 2:39 PM EDT",V,"Open banking may be a global trend, but implementation is fragmented. The fintech startups doing the legwork to make it a reality in smaller markets could become M&A targets for incumbents like Visa.One of these is Y Combinator alum Fintoc, a B2B fintech startup that has raised a $7 million Series A round of funding to consolidate its presence in its home country, Chile, and in Mexico, where it expanded one year ago.Fintoc's product is an API that lets online businesses accept instant payments coming directly from the customer's bank account. Known as accounts to accounts, or A2A, this method offers an alternative to credit card transactions, with fewer intermediaries.For end users, A2A can be as frictionless as an online credit card payment. Instead of entering card details, they can just pick their bank and securely facilitate their bank credentials. But the main selling point is to businesses, which pay a lower commission than the usual credit card transaction fees.Many countries now facilitate A2A, which has created tailwinds for open banking companies such as Plaid, Visa-owned Tink, TrueLayer and Volt. More generalist fintech players like Adyen and Stripe have also closed partnerships to offer A2A payments to their customers.Latin America, however, isn't particularly easy to enter for global players, nor very attractive. It is highly fragmented, and many countries still lag behind in financial inclusion: Fewer than half of Mexican adults have a bank account, according to World Development Indicators.Mexico's low banking penetration is a problem, but also an opportunity for Fintoc, CEO Crist√≥bal Griffero told TechCrunch. He expects neobanks to address the issue, but it will take time. ""If we are there right before this boom, we'll be able to grow with the market.""Fintoc's home market was less challenging in some ways. This helped it get quite significant traction: ""In 2023, 1,807,000 people paid products, services and bills using Fintoc. This is approximately 13% of Chile's population,"" content manager Pedro Casale wrote in an email. Fintoc says it is used by more than 1.2 million people monthly in Chile.These numbers are even more impressive considering that Fintoc faces competition from other players such as ETpay and Khipu. But its large clients mean that it is tied to frequent use cases such as topping up public transportation cards, making e-commerce purchases, covering bills and paying credit installments.Chile's population size, however, puts a ceiling on Fintoc's potential growth, Griffero said. ""You have the limit that we are 20 million inhabitants, so after a certain amount of revenue, it is very difficult to reach $100 million in ARR. It gets very complicated and you have to go out.""Story continuesThe necessity to expand applies to any Chilean fintech. But Fintoc's roadmap also reflects that the market has considerably changed compared to 2021.Toned-down expansionWhen Griffero and co-founder Lukas Zorich joined Y Combinator's winter 2021 batch, their pitch was pretty straightforward: They were building ""Plaid for LatAm."" That's no longer the case; Plaid's model was too advanced for the region, and the idea to launch all across the region was too ambitious.VCs, too, have come to the same conclusion, as Fintoc learned during its fundraising process, Griffero said.""I believe that the funds are still here, only that their thesis has changed a little. Now you have to explain very well why [you'd go into] each country. Saying ""I am X for LatAm"" is no longer something appealing to investors, especially those in San Francisco, because Latin America is super fragmented and suddenly it doesn't make sense to be in every country. So maybe it's Mexico, Chile and one other country, not Brazil or not Colombia; not ""we are going to do all of Latin America because we are close.""This more measured approach doesn't warrant mega-rounds. ""In 2021 this round would probably have been five times larger,"" Griffero said. But maybe that's for the best; TechCrunch followed more than one unicorn having to scale back on its pan-LatAm expansion and lay off staffers as a result.Food delivery company JOKR confirms closing of Santiago, Medellin operationsFintoc expects a lot from its Mexican expansion. ""Mexico is the market we will most care about in the next two years and we expect it will represent the bulk of Fintoc's revenue within the next two years, Griffero said. But the startup is taking it step by step: Out of its team of 48 employees, only five are based in Mexico. Zorich moved there last year, but Griffero might not do so until next year.With more onerous plans, Fintoc's Series A round may not have happened at all. In the first quarter of the year, fintech funding slowed to its lowest level since 2017, CB Insights reported. In Latin America, it's when compared to Q2 2021 that the drop is most blatant: Fintech startups from the region collectively raised $6 billion across 94 deals then, compared to only $0.4 billion last quarter.Funding LatAm fintech is less en vogue than three years ago. But for VCs willing to wait, the rise of open banking across the region could eventually result in interesting M&As. Not just in Brazil, where Visa shelled out $1 billion for Pismo, a payments infrastructure that will give it access to Pix, the country's ubiquitous instant payment system. In Mexico, too: In 2021, Mastercard acquired fintech startup Arcus, whose co-founder I√±igo Rumayor participated in Fintoc's Series A round.Fintoc's main investors also have connections to its target market. Brazilian fund Monashees, which previously participated in Fintoc's seed round and has now made a follow-on investment, has an office there. And its Series A lead, Propel, is based in the U.S., but was able to facilitate introductions to Mexican banks, an important step for the startup's expansion.""The closer we get to the payment rails, the better payment experience we can offer,"" Griffero said in a statement.Fintech funding slows to the lowest level since 2017On the client side, Fintoc is targeting Mexican businesses that accept offline payment methods such as cash payments and post-pay methods, where customers must visit a physical location to complete their transaction. This makes A2A a pretty clear upgrade; but eventually, Griffero hopes it will also replace debit cards, and later on, offer a solid alternative to credit cards.Mastercard and Visa will clearly face more competition as instant payments become commonplace with systems such as Pix in Brazil, but also UPI and India and FedNow in the U.S. A recent Bain & Company report estimates that 90% of today's payments revenue could ""migrate to software vendors, major technology firms, and other contenders."" This explains some of their past acquisitions, and we wouldn't be surprised if others followed.View comments"

What's more, the buy signals' tendency to generate a 3% return over the following 20 days is triple the 1% gain that has occurred during all other time periods, according to the bank.The most recent buy signal was flashed after positioning data showed a sharp decline amid this month's 5% sell-off in the broader stock market.""Our US Tactical Positioning Monitor just hit our threshold for an attractive set-up for the S&P 500, based on the fact that it dipped to -1.5z over the past 4 weeks,"" JPMorgan said.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-no-brainer-dividend-120500327.html,Is Coca-Cola a No-Brainer Dividend Stock to Buy While It's Below $65?,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 8:05 AM EDT",KO,"With its popular drinks being sold in 200 countries across the world, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is without a doubt one of the strongest and most widely recognized brands on Earth. The business has been around since the late 1800s, showcasing just how durable demand is over long periods of time.The average investor might have their eyes on this beverage stock because Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway is a large shareholder. The Oracle of Omaha's track record speaks for itself.But is Coca-Cola a no-brainer dividend stock for you to buy below $65? Let's take a closer look.Dominating the industryIn 2023, the business raked in $45.8 billion in revenue. It has 46% market share in the non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink (NARTD) category in the U.S., well ahead of smaller rival PepsiCo.There's no question that the key ingredient to Coca-Cola's success is the brand. Consumers can get soft drinks from an unlimited number of companies, but this one has been around for such a long time, consistently delivering for its end users and their cravings. A powerful brand that resonates with consumers leads to tremendous loyalty.This results in steady demand throughout economic booms and downturns. Revenue held up well throughout the Great Recession. I believe that shows that even when times get tough, people will still buy these beverages.Investors should appreciate Coca-Cola's ability to register consistent profitability. Its gross margin and operating margin have averaged a phenomenal 60% and 26%, respectively, in the past decade.The business generates tons of free cash flow, to the tune of $9.7 billion in 2023. Even after investing in capital expenditures, there are a lot of resources left to fund dividends. The current 3.2% yield is healthy. But even more impressive, Coca-Cola has increased its annual dividend payout in 62 straight years.I see no reason to believe this trend won't continue. Investors who care most about generating income from their investment can do a lot worse than buy Coca-Cola shares.Can the stock beat the market?It's a different story for those investors who are trying to identify stocks that can outperform the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite Index over the long term. If this describes you, you should think twice.Yes, Coca-Cola shares trade below $65, and they are 9% off of their all-time high. However, there are two important reasons why I believe this stock doesn't make for a smart investment for those seeking high returns. One factor to consider is Coca-Cola's growth potential. In the past 10 years, revenue has basically remained flat. And according to Wall Street consensus-analyst estimates, the business will generate $51 billion in sales in 2026, representing just a 10% increase compared to 2023.Story continuesThis points to just how mature the NARTD category is. I'd suspect this industry's revenues won't increase much faster than GDP or population growth. As a scaled operator with a presence all over the globe, this leaves almost no sizable expansion opportunities for Coca-Cola.On its own, limited growth prospects might not be enough of a reason to completely pass on the stock. But what about the valuation?Investors are being asked to pay a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.3 to buy shares right now. That's below their trailing-five-year average. However, it represents a premium to the broader S&P 500. It doesn't seem like a smart move to pay a steep valuation for this business. Even including dividends, the stock has severely underperformed the broader index since April 2019. I expect this to continue.Investors who want to beat the market shouldn't buy shares. But again, income investors might want to take a closer look at Coca-Cola.Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Coca-Cola wasn‚Äôt one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-2-artificial-intelligence-092900636.html,Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead,"Thu, Apr 25, 2024, 11:51 AM EDT",NVDA,"There's no denying that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on a roll. The chip designer has knocked every earnings report out of the park since OpenAI unveiled the ChatGPT artificial intelligence (AI) tool, powered by the company's AI accelerator chips.Trailing sales are up by 126% in just five quarters. Free cash flow soared 610% higher over the same period, and Nvidia's stock price more than quadrupled.Golf claps and finger snaps aplenty, please. Nvidia has made many investors a lot of money in this AI boom, including yours truly.But this isn't the right time to buy more Nvidia shares. The stock is trading at incredibly lofty valuation ratios as the company's investors bet it will continue to dominate the AI hardware arena for years to come. Since I'm not so sure about that, I recently took some Nvidia profits off the table to reinvest in some lower-priced but equally exciting growth stocks.You may not want to sell Nvidia stock today. In any case, I wouldn't recommend buying more of it right now.Due to Nvidia's inflated share price, I suggest you steer clear of buying this stock until it cools down a bit. But if you insist on buying AI stocks right now, take a closer look at digital design software veteran Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) and semiconductor pioneer Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).Autodesk's AI-driven strategyAutodesk is leaning into the AI opportunity. The company is already a leader in generative AI tools, particularly in the field of professional-quality 3D images.""We can already generate 3D representations from images 10 times faster and with vastly higher quality than currently available 3D AI,"" CEO Andrew Anagnost said in February's fourth-quarter earnings report.To build on this industry-leading expertise, the company is rebuilding its core products around a shared, AI-driven design engine. The master plan is all about product lifecycle management, where a computer-aided design (CAD) can move from one team to another within each client's operating structure without running into red tape and speed bumps. At the same time, software improvements and new features created to serve one target market can easily find use cases across other customers and project types.Again, Autodesk relies on high-quality machine learning and generative AI tools to deliver these planned efficiencies.These are early days in a ""multiyear process,"" and the upgrade path hasn't been smooth so far. Sales are growing but not skyrocketing. Free cash flow is down in recent quarters -- and Autodesk has delayed the filing of year-end financial documents, as auditors found inconsistencies in the fourth-quarter's cash-flow calculations.Story continuesAs a result, investors took a step back from the late paperwork issue, and Autodesk's stock is down 17% in the last month. It trades at 8.6x trailing sales and 36x free cash flow. That's a bargain next to Nvidia, with respective ratios of 33.8 and 76, respectively.Yes, Autodesk is growing slower than Nvidia right now, and I don't love the potentially flawed financial reporting. Still, I'm downright excited about the company's long-term business prospects as the modular, AI-powered software platform evolves.I bought my first Autodesk shares two years ago, as the industry veteran's stock looked undervalued from a long-term perspective. After a few wild swings, the stock price is back where it was in April 2022, but trailing sales are up by 20% and the AI catalyst should add more value over time.Intel's strategic shift toward AI and chipmaking servicesIntel's business model is also transforming. The company is still the leading name in PC and server processors, but Advanced Micro Devices is gaining ground in both markets. On the other hand, Intel taps into the AI boom from several angles, and the recently launched processor manufacturing business doubled its revenue in 2023.This ain't your grandfather's Chipzilla anymore. Some investors aren't comfortable with Intel's shifting strategy, expecting the company to defend its traditional processor business at all costs. But I would much rather own stock in a company willing to change with the times than watch an outdated titan sticking to its old guns. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid doesn't have a happy ending, y'know?The Intel Gaudi 2 may not be the fastest AI accelerator in the world, but AI system builders often don't look for maximum performance per chip. Intel delivers where it counts.""Our Gaudi 2 AI accelerators continue to demonstrate price performance leadership compared to the most popular GPUs,"" CEO Pat Gelsinger said in January's earnings call. ""In a recent blog published by Databricks, Gaudi 2 was shown to clearly deliver the best training and inference performance per dollar based on public cloud pricing.""Moreover, the next-generation Gaudi 3 accelerator will launch later this year with quadruple the processing power and double the networking speed of the current chip.<img alt=""A technician places a silicon wafer in a plastic holder for further processing."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u9_Ws9jq6pCw0IX93ihb3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/4c3f45414ae0525f9e23709d59734a16 class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.The Xeon line of server processors stands front and center in the AI systems market, too, since the supercomputers that train the beefiest large language models (LLMs) use these chips to control each accelerator module's data-crunching activities. Five of the 10 fastest supercomputers in the world today rely on thousands of Intel Xeon processors. The largest one, Argonne National Laboratory's Aurora system, even uses Intel GPUs instead of Nvidia's or AMD's. Those chip sales add up in a hurry when each processor costs at least $11,600.The new and improved Intel is a serious AI competitor, with important side gigs in traditional processor sales and semiconductor manufacturing. Intel is currently consuming cash due to costly upgrades and new construction of chipmaking facilities. But the stock trades at just 2.7x sales, more than 30% below its 52-week highs.Investors looking for a promising AI strategy and a flexible operating model might find Intel an intriguing choice, especially at its current valuation. And that's why I'd much rather buy Intel and Autodesk shares than double down on my Nvidia position right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Intel wasn‚Äôt one of them.
