It has grown rapidly in recent years, hitting more than $100 billion worth of Tether tokens in circulation in March. ""In the last few years we have seen the usage of USDTgoing from pure cryptocurrency trading to being basically the most used digital dollar in the world"", Ardoino said on the sidelines of the Token2049 crypto conference in Dubai, where industry enthusiasts gathered despite heavy rains this week disrupting life in the desert city.""Almost the entire user base is (in) emerging markets"", he said, mentioning Turkey, Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina and ""African countries"", where dollars can sometimes be in short supply.""Last year for sure Argentina has been booming,"" he added.Ardoino said Tether had just over 300 million users globally.""We want to be the dollar for the last mile, for the unbanked,"" he said. Regulators have long warned about market risks from the adoption of crypto assets. The Bank for International Settlements said in a paper last year that crypto assets had amplified financial risks in developing economies, in contrast to their ""illusory appeal of being a simple and quick solution for financial challenges"".In Argentina, cryptocurrency exchanges can play a role in the currency market, with locals and international traders alike using the Tether-peso pair on crypto exchanges as a proxy for the U.S. dollar-to-peso exchange rate. Crypto markets have mostly recovered from the collapses that saw prices plunge in 2022. Bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, hit an all-time high of $73,803.25 in March, driven by excitement around inflows into U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which Ardoino said had also supported Tether's growth.Story continuesArdoino, who became CEO in December while keeping the interim role of chief technology officer, said the company was hiring more people and would have around 150 staff, from about 100 currently, as it expands into new areas such as AI.U.S. regulators have warned banks that stablecoin reserves could be subject to rapid outflows, for example if holders rushed to exchange such tokens back into traditional currency.Tether, the third biggest cryptocurrency, says it maintains its dollar peg by holding dollar-based reserves that match the volume of cryptocurrencies it has created.(Additional reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft in London; Editing Tommy Reggiori-Wilkes and Mark Potter)"

^GSPC","(Bloomberg) -- A selloff in the world’s largest technology companies hit stocks, with traders also shunning riskier assets ahead of the weekend amid geopolitical uncertainties.Most Read from BloombergElon Wants His Money BackNew York’s Rich Get Creative to Flee State Taxes. Auditors Are On to ThemDubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits CityIsrael Reported to Have Launched Retaliatory Strike on Iran‘Mag Seven’ Get Crushed to Lead Losses in Stocks: Markets WrapEquities fell at end of a week that saw the S&P 500 dropping below 5,000, following a rally that sent the benchmark to all-time highs and spurred warnings for a consolidation. A drumbeat of hawkish Fedspeak and a flare-up in inflation worries have weighed heavily on sentiment, with investors trimming their bets on the keenly anticipated central bank pivot. While the latest tensions in the Middle East seemed contained, traders opted for a cautious stance.That being said, nothing can be taken for granted, and markets may remain on edge — especially considering the looming weekend risk, according to Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. He added that inflation continues to be a focal point due to its potential influence on monetary policy.“The stock market has been declining in recent weeks because rate cut expectations have dropped significantly — and investors are not surprisingly taking some profits after the strong market performance seen during the first quarter,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management.The S&P 500 is on track for its sixth consecutive drop — the longest losing streak since October 2022. The Nasdaq 100 fell 1.5%. The “Magnificent Seven” megacaps that have powered this year’s surge slumped, with Nvidia Corp. down over 4% and Apple Inc. heading for its lowest close in almost a year. Netflix Inc. tumbled on a bearish forecast.Treasury 10-year yields declined one basis point to 4.62% — almost erasing an earlier plunge of 14 basis points. Oil trimmed a major advance to trade only marginally higher after Iranian media appeared to downplay the effect of Israeli strikes.Story continuesThe stock market is heading toward its third consecutive weekly decline — the longest losing run since September. After a 10% gain in the first quarter — the strongest start to a year since 2019 — investors have been increasingly skeptical about how much further it could go over the near term, even accounting for the continued strength in the economy.“Geopolitical and political uncertainty join inflation, rates, and the Fed in pressuring markets, driving a rapid and dramatic shift in the complexion of markets and the attitude of investors,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide.Federal Reserve officials have said they will need to see more data to become confident enough that inflation is headed to their 2% target before starting to cut interest rates. Investors have dramatically pared bets on easing since the beginning of the year, with markets now seeing one or two rate cuts as likely in 2024, down from as many as six a few months ago.Fed Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said progress on inflation has stalled, meriting a pause to allow incoming data to provide more insight into how the economy evolves.Economists in the latest Bloomberg monthly survey reduced the probability of a recession in the next 12 months to 30% — the smallest odds since June 2022 and down from 35% last month. The upper boundary of the Fed’s target range for its benchmark interest rate, currently 5.5%, will fall only to 4% by the end of 2025, according to the survey. That’s a half percentage point higher than respondents expected just a month ago.Investors are pulling money out of equities as a strong US economy and sticky inflation fuel concerns that the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists.A team led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note that good economic news is now bad news for stocks, a shift in mindset from the first quarter when “good news = good.” Evidence of this is the $21.1 billion investors redeemed from stock funds in the two weeks through Wednesday, the most in a fortnight since December 2022, BofA said, citing data from EPFR Global.Companies that move goods around and serve as a bellwether for the American economy sent up a smoke signal this week.The Dow Jones Transportation Average has tumbled to levels last seen in November and is on track to end lower for the third straight week. Moreover, the losses pushed the index deep below its 200-day moving average, a long-term trend indicator that traders closely watch. It is also on pace for the worst month since October.The US stock market’s retreat from all-time highs set late last month is giving investors parked in cash an opening to buy in, according to Sinead Colton Grant, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon’s wealth management arm.The three-week slump in the S&P 500 Index is a healthy consolidation by traders after it soared 10% in the first quarter, on top of a 24% gain in 2023, she said. From here, Colton Grant expects the rally to not only resume but broaden based on strong earnings growth and continuing economic momentum, potentially pushing the S&P 500 beyond the higher end of her 5,000-5,400 target range before 2024 closes out.Corporate Highlights:Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. says an illegal form of short selling might be behind the battering of its stock and it’s asking regulators at Nasdaq Inc. to step in.American Express Co. reported revenue that topped estimates in the first three months of the year as consumers continued to flock to the company’s premium credit-card offerings.Procter & Gamble Co., the maker of Pampers diapers and Dawn dish soap, reported quarterly sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates, overshadowing an improved profit outlook.SLB, the world’s biggest oil-services provider, said it is gearing up for a rebound in activity in the Northern Hemisphere during the second quarter after starting off the year with typical seasonal slowness.Super Micro Computer Inc. sank after the maker of servers announced the date of its third-quarter results but didn’t pre-announce results.The US Federal Aviation Administration is investigating an incident where a passenger was apparently granted unauthorized access to the cockpit of a United Airlines Holdings Inc. charter flight traveling from Denver to Toronto.Nordstrom Inc.’s founding family has notified the board of its interest in taking the company private.Mondi Plc walked away from a possible bidding battle for UK packaging rival DS Smith Plc, a move that secures a deal for US bidder International Paper Co.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 0.3% as of 1:52 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.3%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%The MSCI World index fell 0.5%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changedThe euro rose 0.1% to $1.0657The British pound fell 0.5% to $1.2375The Japanese yen was little changed at 154.61 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 1.8% to $64,642.67Ether rose 0.5% to $3,084.81BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined one basis point to 4.62%Germany’s 10-year yield was little changed at 2.50%Britain’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 4.23%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.8% to $83.39 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.6% to $2,394.37 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Farah Elbahrawy, Esha Dey and Alexandra Semenova.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite DemandThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

VFSWW","Shares of VinFast Auto (NASDAQ: VFS) slumped as much as 30% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The Vietnam-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer reported poor growth and earnings for the first quarter of 2024, causing investors to sell off the stock. As of this writing, shares of VinFast Auto have fallen 96% from all-time highs set in late 2023 when it made its debut on the public markets.Here's why Vinfast Auto stock slipped around 30% this week.Slowing growth, elusive profitsVinFast Auto makes EVs and has global ambitions for distribution. In fact, it has plans for a manufacturing facility in North Carolina as it hopes to expand to the United States market. The problem is that building EVs is expensive and comes with a lot of competition from larger players. This is showing up in Vinfast's financials, which look ugly at the moment.In the first quarter of 2024, VinFast delivered about 9,700 EVs to customers, down from 13,500 in the fourth quarter of 2023. At such a small scale -- competitors such as Tesla sell over 1 million units per year -- VinFast's income statement looks ugly. In Q1, it generated $300 million in revenue. On these sales, it had a gross loss (meaning its variable costs were higher than its sales) of $150 million. Add in operating expenses and the company posted an operating loss of $422 million on just $300 million in revenue. VinFast needs to scale its EV plans quickly if it is to reach profitability and positive cash flow.Even worse, VinFast has major financing costs, sitting at $173 million last quarter. Add it all together and the company is losing money at a rapid rate.Stay far away from this stockAt the end of Q1, VinFast Auto had just $123 million in cash on the balance sheet. This leaves it with less than a quarter before it needs to raise more money. It is no surprise then to see the company paring back its ambitions for its North Carolina plant. And the stock still isn't cheap, trading at a market cap of $6 billion when it only does $1.4 billion in sales and generates zero profits.Story continuesMaking cars is difficult.

But few have been amenable enough to stand in front of a microphone and explain what went wrong, especially when it’s a stock as volatile and contentious as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, long-time investor Charles Harris had no problem discussing his crash-and-burn, especially since he broke his rules.Don't Miss:This prop trading firm allows traders to receive 100% of the first $25,000 per account and 90% beyond that. Heres how you can get in on the profit.Breaking the RulesHarris is a long-time portfolio manager at O'Neil Capital Management Inc. whose aggressive style has produced eye-watering gains and stomach-churning losses. But Harris's start was unceremonious, and he found himself trading irrationally with little plan or expectation. Harris’s results improved after developing a system of rules, like position sizing and anticipating price action.Over 30-plus years, Harris has seen plenty of ups and downs in the market. He traded through the meltdown of Long-Term Capital Management, the dot-com boom and bust, the great financial crisis and the subsequent 10-year bull market run. Harris had more good years than bad and continued ascending the ranks at O'Neil, moving from research assistant to analyst to portfolio manager. However, it wasn't until 2013 that Harris found the stock that would become the focus of his investment process (and eventual rulebreaking) — Tesla.Highest Of Highs And Lowest Of LowsHarris was no stranger to losses. Between 2014 and 2017, he suffered a devastating drawdown that saw nearly 90% of his net worth evaporate. Harris has been open about what this period has cost him beyond money: confidence, self-respect and, eventually, his marriage.Tesla is one of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500, so imagine the whiplash an investor could get back in 2013 when the company was a long way from a household name. Harris was an early enthusiast of the stock and believed the company had some fundamentally innovative technology on its hands. And despite a career defined by sticking to his rules, Harris began to let his guidelines slide on volatile stocks like Tesla.Story continuesTesla was a big winner in 2020 and 2021, rising from a split-adjusted COVID crash low of $23 to an all-time high of $414. Harris was there the whole way, riding the wave and building an eight-figure trading account thanks to building a margin position. Despite some warning signs, Harris's conviction remained and he stuck with his Tesla position, which suffered a devastating collapse in 2022. Tesla shares plunged to a low of $101 by the start of 2023, and Harris's eight-figure portfolio was now a six-figure portfolio.Harris explained his losses in an honest and heartfelt video, openly discussing how using margin and ignoring his own trading rules led to one of the largest blowups of his career. Despite the losses, Harris managed to preserve his account through some defensive trading and now preaches about the risk of using margin in a high-conviction stock.Losses often provide better lessons than wins because mistakes offer a chance for self-reflection and improvement.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-doesnt-seem-too-170907709.html,Wall Street doesn't seem too keen on a potential Salesforce-Informatica pairing,"Fri, April 19, 2024, 1:09 PM EDT",INFA-0.97%WatchlistWatchlistWatchlistPatternNeutralCRM-1.04%,"When a significant rumor emerged last weekend that Salesforce was interested in buying Informatica, a legacy data management company that predates the cloud, it didn’t take long for investors to express their negative feelings on the idea. In fact, since the start of business on Monday, stockholders on both sides of the equation have been making it clear that they aren’t happy with a potential coupling between the two companies.After the story broke that Salesforce was the suitor, the company’s stock price began dropping, and is down almost 4.6% over the last five days. This probably reflects investors' concerns that the deal would see them overpaying for a moderate amount of additional revenue and not a ton of innovation. For Informatica investors, it was the opposite: The price was too low to warrant selling — they wanted more, more, more — and their stock also dropped, down over 7% over the same period.That doesn’t mean a deal won’t happen, but it was frankly a surprise to even hear that Salesforce was back in the big M&A discussion and looking at another major deal after taking several years off. It seems that activist pressure last year combined with lower growth and higher interest rates had forced the company to rethink growth through M&A and embrace the joys of profitability and free cash flow. To appease them, Salesforce was able to stave off activist investors by being more conservative; conducting some big layoffs; and even disbanding the company’s internal M&A committee, which helped identify and vet possible M&A targets.But you can’t keep an acquisitive company down forever, and historically it has been extremely acquisitive, buying 74 companies since its founding in 1999, with 13 coming in 2020 alone, per Crunchbase data. The biggest by far of that bunch was the $28 billion deal to buy Slack at the end of 2020. After that, Salesforce went mostly quiet with just six much more modest deals over the next three years.Story continuesAs Salesforce projects growth slipping into single-digit numbers next fiscal year, perhaps the company sees a target like Informatica as a way to buy some revenue and brute force some additional percentage points. At the same time, it would be grabbing a data management platform at a time when getting your data house in order is particularly important in the age of generative AI.It’s worth noting that SnapLogic CEO Gaurav Dhillon, who co-founded Informatica back in the 1990s, told MarketWatch this week that he thinks the coupling would be a bad idea for both companies and their customers. Though Dhillon is not exactly a neutral observer, he might not be wrong, either.Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research, sees Salesforce’s own data integration tooling as a stronger offering. “The potential acquisition of Informatica is quite curious as the client base and tech is not cutting edge. Although it could potentially solve a data integration challenge that Salesforce has had, Data Cloud is already a strong offering, so I’m not sure if this deal makes sense,” Wang told TechCrunch.Salesforce could be repositioning itself as a data companyBut Arjun Bhatia, a financial analyst at William Blair sees some upside to a possible deal from a strategy perspective. “The reported price is high, and it’s a bigger deal than I would have expected for them to start off with M&A again, but I think it makes sense strategically. Better to invest in the infrastructure first before getting too far down the application/copilot path. It’s a nicely profitable business, too, which is different from past acquisitions,” Bhatia said.Nobody knows how this will end up, or who is right, but it’s worth exploring the underlying financials of these two companies to see if a deal would even make sense.To buy or not buy, that is the questionSalesforce grew 11% in its most recent fiscal year. The company also told investors that it expects to grow by 9% in its current fiscal 2025. Salesforce’s trailing and forward growth numbers likely led to the company announcing a dividend for the first time along with boosting its share buyback program to $10 billion. Meta announced its first dividend around the same time.By projecting 9% revenue growth and announcing a program to directly pay investors for holding its shares, Salesforce seemed to herald a different era for its business. It would grow at a modest pace, generate mountains of cash — the CRM giant had free cash flow of $3.26 billion in its most recent quarter — and dole out a large piece of those funds to investors through dividends and reductions to its share count.You can imagine why some investors are therefore slightly confused that Salesforce is considering spending more than $10 billion on Informatica, a purchase that would add some revenue scale to Salesforce but little in the form of future revenue growth.Informatica is also far smaller than Salesforce, making its potential revenue bump to Marc Benioff’s company modest. In its most recent quarter, Salesforce had revenue of $9.29 billion, and Informatica turned in $445.2 million. Salesforce had $1.45 billion worth of net income, and Informatica had $64.3 million.Comparing the top and bottom lines of an acquiring company and its target will always lead to disparate numerical scale; but importantly, Informatica is not growing so quickly as to represent a material new source of expansion for Salesforce. Total revenue at Informatica grew 12% in its most recent quarter, around what Salesforce itself posted.The ace up Informatica’s sleeve is that while its total revenue growth is slow, one important segment of its revenues is expanding quickly. The company reported that its “Cloud Subscription ARR,” or the recurring revenue associated with its “hosted cloud contracts” grew 37% to $616.8 million in its most recent quarter.Salesforce escaped from the jaws of activists to find stability in 2023Certainly, 37% growth is in a different league than 9% or 10% or 11%. But Informatica’s cloud ARR is expected to grow 35% per the company to a range of “$826 million to $840 million” in its new fiscal year. At the top end of that range, all cloud subscription revenue from the smaller company would equate to around 2% of Salesforce’s expected revenue in its current fiscal year. If we were to compare Informatica cloud net-new ARR that it expects this year instead, the percentage becomes even smaller.Put another way, the growth business at Informatica, while very important to its own worth and future, is very, very small compared to Salesforce’s current size, and would therefore have a modest-at-best impact on its overall growth rates.If growth at Informatica post-acquisition is not expected to put Salesforce on a new, higher trajectory in growth terms and also does not deliver scads of new profitability, the deal has to rest on strategic impacts that are harder to measure at this distance. Certainly at the expected price tag, it seems that Salesforce would be paying steeply for a shot in the arm that looks more like a mosquito bite than something life-altering."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-recoup-losses-rally-170840588.html,Short sellers recoup losses as rally in US stocks loses steam,"Fri, April 19, 2024, 1:08 PM EDT",,"By Shristi Achar A

(Reuters) - Short sellers have been raking it in over the last 30 days as receding bets of an early interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve triggered a selloff in the equity market.

Traders have made a mark-to-market profit of more than $25 billion up to Thursday from covering their short positions, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, more than erasing their $14.8 billion in losses so far this year.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Short sellers were in a bind for most of last year as a raging bull market, partly powered by enthusiasm around AI as well as hopes of an early rate cut, forced them to book nearly $190 billion in losses for 2023.

The current weakness in the market allows them to cover a portion of those heavy losses. The benchmark S&P 500 index is down about 5% so far in April and off by a similar margin from its record high hit last month.

THE NUMBERS

Overall U.S. & Canadian equity short exposure fell by $50 billion to $1.08 trillion in the last 30 days, largely due to a fall in the mark-to-market value of short positions and short covering.

Mark-to-market change is the method of measuring the value of assets that can fluctuate over time, adjusting the asset's value to reflect its current market price.

THE DETAILS

Bets against bitcoin-focussed MicroStrategy and chip stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer were profitable for traders during the period in dollar terms.

That was despite those stocks witnessing the largest mark-to-market decrease in short positions.

However, short positions on oil giant Exxon Mobil, Google-parent Alphabet and e-commerce company Amazon.com turned out to be least profitable for traders.

Investors are buying in, sending shares of Hilltop up about 5% as of noon ET Friday.Finding ways to offset mortgage weaknessHilltop earned $0.42 per share in the quarter, beating Wall Street's $0.25-per-share consensus estimate, despite net interest income that was down $18 million year over year to $103.6 million. The company was able to offset that decline via a reversal of credit losses thanks to an improving local economy, as well as an increase in broker-dealer net revenue.The company continues to see declines in its mortgage production unit but was able to counter that by selling mortgage loans at a gain.CEO Jeremy B. Ford called the quarter ""a continuation in market trends that were experienced through 2023,"" but said the bank is holding up well.""The elevated interest rate environment continues to impact our net interest margin primarily through increased borrowing costs,"" Ford said. ""Additionally, a lack of housing inventory and pressured home buying affordability limited mortgage origination volumes.""Is Hilltop a buy after its strong earnings report?The credit loss improvement speaks well to the lending environment and Hilltop's ability to make good loans in tough conditions. But the company is going to find it hard to surge ahead until the mortgage market rebounds.Hilltop shares are poised to go higher over time, but developments well beyond the bank's control including the Federal Reserve's rate movement, the subsequent impact on Treasury yields and mortgage rates, and tight labor markets cloud the near-term outlook.For investors seeking bank stocks with upside potential Hilltop is worthy of a place on the watch list, but until macroeconomic conditions turn, patience will be required.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Hilltop right now?Before you buy stock in Hilltop, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hilltop wasn’t one of them.

-0.97%","By Saqib Iqbal AhmedNEW YORK (Reuters) - A cocktail of interest rate anxiety and geopolitical tensions is keeping U.S. stock investors defensive and driving Wall Street’s most closely watched volatility gauge to its highest level in half a year.With the S&P 500 down nearly 5% from its late March record closing high, the Cboe Volatility Index broke above 20 overnight as tensions between Iran and Israel escalated, its highest since late October.Often called Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" the VIX is an options-based measure of investor demand for protection against near-term stock swings. It has climbed in recent weeks as signs of stubborn inflation eroded expectations for how deeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year and as worries grow over a spreading conflict in the Middle East.The S&P 500 is still up around 5% year-to-date and stock bulls are hopeful a strong earnings season could bolster investor confidence in the weeks ahead.Nevertheless, some believe a jump in volatility is warranted following a run that has seen the S&P 500 gain as much as 28% from its October lows.""In hindsight the market was a little overbought a few weeks ago and there was a little bit too much optimism, exuberance, FOMO,"" said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager for Rational Equity Armor Fund, using the acronym for “fear of missing out.”""You put some challenges in its way, such as, rising interest rates and a potential war ... it makes a lot of sense to back off,"" he said.The VIX has not closed above 20 for 121 straight days, the longest such streak since 2018.Stocks were weaker on Friday after reports Israel launched an attack on Iranian soil, in the latest tit-for-tat exchange between the two foes. The S&P 500 was recently down 0.4%, on pace for its sixth straight session of losses, the longest losing streak since October 2022.Market participants noted the VIX is trading 1.26 points higher than its May futures, the index's largest premium to front month futures in four months. That is in contrast to a 0.75 point discount the front month futures have typically traded at over the last decade, data from LSEG showed.Story continuesAnalysts said the so-called “inversion” highlights investors' preoccupation with near-term threats to the market. It ""tells us people are more concerned about the here and now,"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.Tigay, of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, noted that while the VIX has climbed to its highest point in months, it remains below levels that have in the past marked a crescendo of investor fears.""Maybe that could be a sign that there could be some more downside to come,"" he said.(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Additional reporting by Laura Matthews; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Chris Reese)"

Watchlist","Shares of streaming-video platform Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) slumped on Friday after the company reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024. The company's numbers looked great but investors seem concerned with a confusing change in its disclosures going forward. As a result, Netflix stock was down 8% as of 11:45 a.m. ET.A good quarter overshadowed by a questionIn Q1, Netflix kept building upon recently improving trends in the business. The company's revenue was up 15% year over year to $9.4 billion -- its third consecutive quarter of accelerated growth. And it had operating income of $2.6 billion, which was its best quarter ever for this metric.Netflix's management gave upbeat guidance for the rest of 2024 as well. Specifically, it expects 13% to 15% top-line growth, which is impressive for a company of this size. And it raised its full-year operating margin guidance to 25%, up from previous guidance of 24%.While all of this was good, investors couldn't look past a change from Netflix's management. The company always reports its subscriber metrics. For example, it ended Q1 with 270 million paid memberships, up 16% from the prior-year period. But starting next year, Netflix won't be reporting this number regularly.Investors believe this change means that Netflix will lose subscribers going forward, which is why the stock is down.Does it matter?It's important to point out that Netflix doesn't see it this way. Management said that, unlike times past, it now has multiple subscription tiers and advertising, which makes its subscriber count less important than it used to be. In other words, when there was only one source of revenue for Netflix, its subscriber number directly correlated to its financials. Now it doesn't.Be that as it may, it seems that Netflix could still easily supply the subscriber number if it wanted to. Therefore, some degree of concern is valid. I wouldn't necessarily call it a red flag, but maybe a light yellow one.Story continuesThat said, the numbers were still great for Netflix in Q1 and the guidance for the year was strong. Investors shouldn't let an unanswered question completely detract from this otherwise strong performance.Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

And believe it or not, Wells Fargo is to blame.This morning the bank reiterated its equal weight (i.e., hold) rating on the popular artificial intelligence (AI) stock, saying it thinks the shares are worth $960. Considering the stock closed at $928 Thursday evening, that doesn't sound so bad... except for one thing.One bad thing about Supermicro stockSuper Micro Computer announced this morning that it will report its fiscal third-quarter 2024 earnings on Tuesday, April 30. Now, here's the thing: Seven of the last eight times Super Micro has announced an upcoming earnings report, says Wells Fargo, the company paired this news with a preannouncement of better-than-expected earnings.That didn't happen this time.All Supermicro said is that the earnings would be released, and not that they would be good earnings. And in Wells' view, this should be ""considered a negative, important AI data point.""How scared should investors be?Now, there's no need to panic. As Wells Fargo pointed out in its note on StreetInsider this morning, the single time (out of the last eight times) that Supermicro phrased an earnings announcement this way, it did at least announce ""in line"" earnings, basically matching its prior guidance. Assuming the same holds true this time around, that probably means investors can rest assured Q3 sales will still come in within the $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion range that management previously promised, and that earnings will still fall somewhere between $4.79 and $5.64 per share.Still, when you consider that most analysts are expecting Supermicro to earn $5.84 per share this quarter, this does raise the risk that the company might miss at least the analysts' earnings number. And that alone could be enough to hurt the stock.Story continuesThat's the risk you take when investing in a stock that costs 72 times earnings.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

A near-death experience at New York Community has investors on edge about a potential bank run there or at other institutions in region, putting pressure on bank stocks.Earnings at Metropolitan Bank should help make the case that no two banks are the same. The company earned $1.46 per share on sales of $66.7 million, topping Wall Street's $1.34 per share on $64.56 million consensus estimate. Total deposits stood at $6.2 billion at quarter-end, an increase of $500 million since Dec. 31 and of $1.1 billion in the last 12 months.The bank is also handling the higher interest rate environment relatively well, with net interest margin up slightly from year-end to 3.4%.""As the only true mid-sized commercial bank headquartered in NYC, we continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders while simultaneously and diligently preparing the bank for the future,"" CEO Mark DeFazio said in a statement.

The Advisorshares Pure US Cannabis ETF has surged more than 30% in that period and the Roundhill Cannabis ETF — ticker WEED — is up more than 40%, outpacing the S&P’s 17% gain. The MJ Pureplay Index, an index tracking 100 cannabis industry stocks globally, has gained 26% in the same timeframe.“This past year, shareholders have been very sticky,” said Dan Ahrens, managing director of Advisorshares Investments LLC. “People have stuck with it even through bad times because they believe that federal reform is finally going to come.”Some of the top performing stocks in the last six months include Trulieve Cannabis Corp, which has more than doubled, Green Thumb Industries Inc. and Curaleaf Holdings Inc., both up more than 35%.Investors are hoping that the US Drug Enforcement Administration will soon announce a reclassification of cannabis that would deem it a controlled substance with medical benefits — like ketamine, anabolic steroids and testosterone. Right now marijuana is grouped with LSD and heroin. The DEA has been reviewing the classification since September after nudging from the Biden administration.Story continuesIf the DEA approves the policy change it would also remove additional taxes that cannabis companies have to pay, weighing on their ability to generate cash. It could also spark further action in Congress to pass a version of the Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act, which would allow banks and credit unions to work with the legal cannabis industry.“I think cannabis stocks could rally 100% with this rescheduling and the momentum that would come with further legislation,” said Ross Gerber, president of Gerber Kawasaki Inc, adding that his firm started buying the Advisorshares ETF recently because it was so beaten down. “No cannabis company that exists today would be here if they weren’t highly efficient.”Pot stocks are trading at deep discounts to where they were just years ago at the start of the cannabis boom. The Advisorshares ETF is down more than 80% since its 2021 peak, while the Roundhill WEED fund has shed more than 50%.Read more: Floundering Weed Stocks Test Wall Street’s Faith in 2024 ReboundThe DEA isn’t bound by a set timeline to make a decision on the reclassification, meaning that an announcement may not come anytime soon.“It’s kind of a fool’s game for anybody to try to figure out the timing of it,” said Ahrens.Similarly, while the SAFER Banking Act was passed by the Senate Banking Committee in September, it has not been brought to a floor vote yet. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), however, has said the legislation is a priority, especially ahead of the November election.Read more: Pot Lobby Hits Capitol Hill to Rebound After Losses“We do see a path for SAFE, though it would require keeping the bill narrow,” TD Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note. “That would allow the bill to be framed as a public safety measure designed to reduce crime around cannabis stores that today do business mostly in cash.”Despite the barriers, cannabis bulls remain optimistic that progress will come and spark momentum for multiple changes in the industry.Ahrens’ conviction hinges on the growing popularity of cannabis products — 24 states, two territories and Washington DC have all legalized weed for recreational use in recent years.The timing of this year’s 4/20 holiday also underscores the popularity of the sector. “Historically, Saturdays are when consumers explore, indulge, and shop for cannabis,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea in a note.Market tracker BDSA data shows that average daily sales on Saturdays in 2023 were 14% higher than the average for all days of the week, he added.“I’m a big believer of a kind of domino effect or snowball effect,” said Ahrens. “We think it could grow dramatically.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite DemandThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/24-hour-stock-trading-brokers-155038233.html,24-hour stock trading: Here are the brokers with overnight trading,"Fri, April 19, 2024, 11:50 AM EDT",,"Traders looking to trade at any hour of the day now have the ability to swap stocks 24 hours a day during the week. A handful of brokers offer all-day trading, also known as overnight trading, so if you’re hunting for a midnight stock snack, you’ll need an account there to feed your urge.Here are the brokers offering 24-hour stock trading and what you need to watch out for.24-hour stock trading: Where you can get startedTypically brokers offering overnight trading open from Sunday 8 pm ET to Friday 8 pm ET – effectively 24 hour trading five days a week. The overnight session fills in the gap between the pre-market session, regular session and after-hours session:Pre-market trading: 4 am ET to 9:30 am ETRegular trading: 9:30 am ET to 4 pm ETAfter-hours trading: 4 pm ET to 8 pm ETOvernight trading: 8 pm ET to 4 am ETYou have a few choices when it comes to trading stocks and funds overnight, including the following brokers.RobinhoodAt Robinhood you’ll be able to trade more than 900 stocks and exchange-traded funds, including large-caps such as the Magnificent 7 stocks and other top large-cap funds. The brokerage has quickly expanded the number of available securities since starting overnight trading in mid-2023.Interactive BrokersInteractive Brokers offers a robust selection of securities after-hours, including more than 10,000 U.S. stocks, ETFs and U.S. equity index options – virtually all you’ll likely want. Clients need to request permission to trade in the night session, and permission is typically granted overnight.Charles SchwabCharles Schwab offers overnight trading through its well-regarded thinkorswim platform. The brokerage offers a narrower selection of funds – just 23 as of April 2024 – but this selection may suffice for those looking to trade the most liquid names at one of the best brokers.E-TradeE-Trade’s overnight offering is more limited than others’ but it does provide access to more than 20 funds, including some of the most popular large-cap ETFs, notably those based on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100. So you can get long the market in the overnight session.Story continuesBest brokers for after-hours trading and pre-market tradingIf you don’t quite need round-the-clock trading, you’ll have plenty of other brokers offering the ability to trade in extended hours, including pre-market hours and after-hours. Some brokers may offer pre-market or after-market hours that are shorter than the complete extended session.Besides the brokers above, you can also trade outside regular hours with the following brokers (all times Eastern):Fidelity Investments: Fidelity offers extended hours from 7 am to 9:30 am and from 4 pm to 8 pm.Merrill Edge: Merrill Edge offers extended hours from 7 am to 9:30 am and from 4 pm to 8 pm.Webull: Webull offers full extended hours – 4 am to 9:30 am and from 4 pm to 8 pm.Tastytrade: Tastytrade offers extended hours from 8 am to 9:30 am and from 4 pm to 8 pm.Ally Invest: Ally Invest offers extended hours from 8 am to 9:30 am and from 4 pm to 5 pm.Firstrade: Firstrade offers extended hours from 8 am to 9:30 am and from 4 pm to 8 pm.This list of brokers offering extended-hours trading is not exhaustive and other brokers may also offer the feature. A great place to begin is looking at the best brokers for stock trading.Risks and drawbacks of 24-hour stock tradingIf you need to get a trade executed, 24-hour trading can make that happen, though it presents some other downsides and drawbacks.Less liquid: Stocks and securities trading in the overnight market are less liquid than in the regular session. Fewer traders are trading a narrower range of stocks, meaning the market lacks a lot of depth. You may not be able to buy and sell at all, and the bid-ask spread will likely be wider than in the regular session, costing you money.Limited securities selection: While major securities such as Microsoft and Apple may have plenty of liquidity for retail traders, don’t expect that small-cap stock to be available. That and thousands of other stocks could be available overnight but may not be.Uncertain prices: While exchanges are required to show the best price across national venues during regular hours, you may not be able to see the next pricing overnight.Higher volatility: The lack of liquidity also means that prices can be volatile overnight. A stock may soar or plunge after-hours but still be largely unaffected when the market opens the next morning.Ability to trade on a whim: The ability to trade 24 hours a day may be just too tempting for some who are apt to trade on a whim and “need action.” The fact that “the casino is open all night” may seriously hurt the bankrolls of many traders.For those looking to build long-term wealth, the advent of 24-hour trading will have no impact at all on their ability to amass wealth. Here are the key steps to becoming a millionaire.Bottom lineThe ability to trade 24 hours may help those with a clear read on the stock market, but long-term buy-and-hold investors may not find the extra hours all that necessary to invest. Less liquidity, a limited range of stocks and uncertain pricing make overnight trading riskier than regular trading."

(Jefferies' Stephen Volkmann, with a $440 target price, has the current Street-high target for Cat.) But what is it about Caterpillar, exactly, that has these analysts lining up to endorse this construction stock?Is Caterpillar stock a buy?It's not the economy. In fact, Zakaria writes in a note covered by TheFly.com that ""construction data points are mixed."" Then again, Caterpillar may not need to produce gee-whiz numbers to prove her right in rating the stock a buy.At last report, analysts are only expecting Caterpillar to post 5.1% sales growth in for the first quarter (about $16 billion in revenue), and earnings only need to rise 3.7% (to $5.09 per share) to keep Wall Street happy. Longer-term expectations are similarly muted, with analysts forecasting only half a percent of earnings growth this year, and a 5.6% increase in 2025. With Zakaria predicting ""resilient margins,"" it shouldn't take much sales expansion for Cat to beat those predictions.And margins are rising. At 20.4%, Cat's operating profit margin is already a full one-third better than the 15% margin it was posting pre-pandemic. My worry is that a 20% margin is way out of line with the company's historical performance, which has tended to max out around 10% profitability. To me, this suggests that its margin is approaching (or has already reached) a cyclical peak -- and is due for a reversion to the mean.If I'm right about this, then a strong margin for Caterpillar is actually more of a warning sign than a reason for optimism. History may not repeat itself exactly, but it does usually rhyme. It may be time for Caterpillar investors to take their profits and find a better bargain.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Caterpillar right now?Before you buy stock in Caterpillar, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Caterpillar wasn’t one of them.

This morning, the company filed its regularly scheduled ""notice of annual meeting of stockholders"" (to be held on June 12). On the agenda: electing directors, approving an auditor, and setting executive salaries.Oh, and one more thing.Virgin Galactic will propose a reverse stock split.What will a reverse split do?As the name suggests, a reverse stock split is the opposite of an ordinary stock split. Instead of giving you more shares, it leaves you with fewer. Virgin Galactic will propose anywhere from a 2-for-1 to a 20-for-1 stock split. Thus, if you own 1,000 shares of Virgin Galactic stock today, you might end up with as few as 50 once the reverse split takes effect.Investors are upset at this prospect -- even though it won't affect the actual value of an investment in Virgin Galactic. Whether you own 1,000 shares of stock worth $1 each or 50 shares of stock worth $20 each, you own $1,000 worth of stock. (Unless, of course, the stock price falls 16.5% on the announcement, as it just did.)Why a reverse split? And why now?So why did Virgin Galactic take this risk? Basically, because its stock has been trading below $1 per share for the last three days. NYSE rules generally require that stocks maintain an average closing price of $1 per share or risk being delisted.So Virgin Galactic is getting ahead of this problem by ensuring its stock won't be flirting with the $1 delisting threshold off and on for days, weeks, or months on end. A reverse split will raise the value of each share to somewhere from $2 to $20.Crazy as it may sound to investors upset by the stock price decline today, this is actually a smart move on management's part.Should you invest $1,000 in Virgin Galactic right now?Before you buy stock in Virgin Galactic, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Virgin Galactic wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tough-trucking-market-hits-ebitda-153157048.html,Tough trucking market hits EBITDA at TriumphPay; other indicators up,"Fri, April 19, 2024, 11:31 AM EDT","TFIN
+0.63%","TriumphPay swung to negative EBITDA but continues to focus on its long-term goals. (Photo: Triumph Financial)In his quarterly note to shareholders, Triumph Financial CEO Aaron Graft predicted that the headline on the earnings might be “TriumphPay swung to a loss this quarter” — one quarter after that growth segment at the trucking-focused bank had become EBITDA-positive.And so it was: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for TriumphPay was negative in the quarter. But as Graft noted several times in his unique quarterly shareholder missive, Triumph Financial is playing the “long game” with TriumphPay, and the first quarter provided numerous data points he touted as showing that the strategy is steadily working.Triumph Financial (NASDAQ: TFIN) also includes the company’s traditional factoring business. The data from that group continues to show the weakness in the trucking market.The average transportation invoice size in Triumph’s factoring segment was $1,771 in the first quarter. It was $1,781 a quarter earlier and $1,773 in the second quarter of 2023. That quarter marked a significant downturn from the first quarter of 2023, when it was $1,911.  (Triumph offers factoring services in other markets and does provide an average invoice size for the company overall — $1,806 for the quarter — but it is the transportation-specific number that provides greater insight on the state of the freight market.)This chart really says it all about where the #trucking market is. It's the average size of the invoices factored by $TFIN in the last 5 quarters. As you can see, it's barely budged for a year and is now at its lowest level in that 12-month stretch, and way below a year ago. pic.twitter.com/CmXmoxNU3S— John Kingston (@JohnHKingston) April 18, 2024Moreover, Graft said that so far in April, the average invoice size has dropped an additional $9.Story continuesDeterioration through the first quarter was evident in the fact that Graft, in his investor letter for the fourth quarter of 2023 released Jan. 23, said January’s average invoice up to that point was $1,839. Given the $1,771 final average for the quarter, market conditions weakened from there.“Freight continues to be softer than most people predicted,” Graft said in his letter’s opening point, a market observation that had been brought home the past couple of days by weak earnings at J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ: JBHT), reduced guidance at Knight-Swift (NYSE: KNX) and an underwhelming performance at Marten (NASDAQ: MRTN). “We are in the 24th month of the longest freight recession in history. It is a grind and there is no way to cheat the grind.”TriumphPay is the segment at Triumph Financial that contains the payments and auditing network built on top of the company’s acquisition of HubTran, which was announced three years ago. Its primary market is targeted at brokers, but it also services factoring companies and some shippers.TriumphPay did turn EBITDA-positive in the fourth quarter of 2023, barely, but slipped to an EBITDA loss of $1.73 million in the first quarter. That is still a vast improvement over a year ago, when the EBITDA loss was $5.42 million.Keeping eyes on the long termBut other data on TriumphPay’s performance supported Graft’s repeated insistence that it is the long-term picture that matters.He said the full TriumphPay network added Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ: WERN) and 3PL Fitzmark Enterprises as clients that are fully or partially “conforming” users of the network, which has a lengthy onboarding process and allows users access to the auditing and payment functions of the TriumphPay network.The latest additions, according to Graft, mean that three of the top five, seven of the top 10 and 57 of the top 100 freight brokers are now fully or partially conforming users.This quarter’s letter sought to establish what is known as a total addressable market (TAM) for TriumphPay. The figure would not include the existing factoring business.Adding to Graft’s remarks in the letter, a spokesman for Triumph Financial said TriumphPay’s current iteration, which doesn’t include its fledgling LoadPay business, has a TAM about $500 million in revenue. The serviceable addressable market (SAM), which is what the company “can reasonably expect to capture,” the spokesman said, is half that.The spokesman added the SAM was calculated based on “current TriumphPay revenue streams.”  Its revenue  currently stands at about $52 million.(LoadPay, announced late last year, was described by Graft on the Triumph Financial earnings call as a “virtual wallet that allows our customers and the fuel cards they use to exchange value with each other, regardless of the time of day, regardless of whether it’s a holiday.”)“If we get more than 50%, great, but 100% is probably not realistic,” the spokesman said in an email to FreightWaves. “We believe 50% as a mark is achievable.”Looking to touch 50% of the marketPositive EBITDA has been touted as a goal, reached only once so far. But Graft has also discussed as a goal the percentage of “touches,” where TriumphPay — whether it’s the fully conforming network or a quick pay solution — is involved in some aspect of a transaction.According to Graft, during the first quarter, TriumphPay “touched” roughly $48.9 million in what the letter referred to as “unique brokered freight transactions.” He said that was more than 44% of the market and up about 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter. It does not include volumes where a shipper is a TriumphPay client.The prediction by Graft: That percentage will rise to 50% by the fourth quarter of this year.The Triumph Financial spokesman said the company’s in-house estimate is that the brokered freight market is about $110 billion per year. The touches measure transactions where TriumphPay is involved through payments, audits or both.He said the $110 billion figure was constructed internally using a variety of sources.Graft’s letter said TriumphPay now has 36 network factors on the payments network and 64 factor clients overall. The spokesman said the 28 that aren’t using the network are utilizing TriumphPay audit capabilities “to validate carrier broker relationships, awareness of disputes and held loads, and view payment status. This helps the factor on expense discipline and resource management.”As far as the traditional factoring business, Tim Valdez, the unit’s head, said on the company’s earnings call that he “had never seen anything like it.”Valdez said first-quarter data suggests that small carriers utilizing Triumph’s factoring services have “stabilized,” but only because “the average invoice amount for the small carrier can’t go any lower … because we’re already at breakeven or below in some cases.”More articles by John KingstonScopelitis seminar delves into lease purchase deals, M&A, ESG and more5 auto haulers combining to create publicly traded trucking companyCTA, OOIDA to appeal court decision upholding AB5 in California truckingThe post Tough trucking market hits EBITDA at TriumphPay; other indicators up appeared first on FreightWaves."

6W-9M
9M+","A JPMorgan analyst recently lowered his price target on 3M (NYSE: MMM) stock to $110 from $118 and retained his neutral rating on it. That new price target still anticipates a near-20% upside over 12 months from the current price of about $92, highlighting the stock's value case.Why the price target changedIt looks like a downgrade, but in reality, the change reflects the spin off of 3M's healthcare business, now trading as Solventum (NYSE: SOLV). 3M shareholders received one share of Solventim for every four they held in 3M. As such, Solventum's stock price of $61.75 equates to $15.44 in ""old 3M."" Adding the $15.44 to 3M's $91 price gives an ""old 3M"" price of about $106.40.The analyst's previous price target for ""old 3M"" was $118, implying an 11% upside. The updated price target after the spinoff is $110, implying a 20% upside. So even though the price target fell, it could still be considered an upgraded price target.What it means to 3M investorsThe JPMorgan price target looks relatively optimistic. Citi's investment firm has a $98 target on it, and Bank of America has a $100 target. All three have neutral ratings.One reason Wall Street is cautious about the stock is concern that 3M will cut its dividend amid ongoing cash calls from legal settlements. RBC Capital thinks a dividend cut of 50% to 70% is coming.3M agreed to pay $6 billion between 2023 and 2029 to resolve litigation over faulty combat arms earplugs. It came to a settlement agreement to pay $12.5 billion from now through 2036 to resolve lawsuits over the contamination of U.S. drinking water supplies with PFAS, aka ""forever chemicals,"" with $9.3 billion of that payout coming in the next five years. Meanwhile, 3M has lost the relatively stable cash flows from its healthcare business and is already in restructuring mode as management tries to turn around its disappointing operational performance.Story continuesAs such, some caution over the stock is perfectly understandable.Should you invest $1,000 in 3M right now?Before you buy stock in 3M, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and 3M wasn’t one of them.

Revenue totaled $21.38 billion, compared with FactSet's call for $21.40 billion.The company earned $2.68 per share a year ago on $24.74 billion in revenue.Story continuesThe company also narrowed its full-year and expects sales of $88 billion to $88.4 billion. That compares with a previous forecast of $87.8 billion to $88.6 billion.JNJ expects adjusted earnings of $10.57 to $10.72 per share, compared to a previous guidance of $10.55 to $10.75 per share.The talc topic came up during the company's earnings call with analysts with Joaquin Duato, chairman and CEO, saying, “We continue to make progress on achieving responsible, final, and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation.”“Overall, I'm proud of the performance in the quarter, both in terms of the solid financial, but also the numerous pipeline advancements,” he said.HSBC upgraded Johnson & Johnson to buy from hold with a price target of $170, up from $169.The shares have retreated to three-year lows despite unchanged fundamentals and well-known headwinds, said the firm's analyst, who sees ""asymmetric risk and attractive upside"" as well as diversity that limits material operational downside for JNJ.While talc litigation is an overhang, the analyst added that a resolution would be positive.In reviewing the results, TheStreet Pro’s Bruce Kamich said Johnson & Johnson’s revenue growth numbers slowed across all categories. He added that the pharma giant also set guidance below consensus as its medical technology, or MedTech, business underperformed.Slow cancer drug sales“The charts and indicators of JNJ suggest we could see further declines in the weeks ahead,” he said. “Avoid the long side of JNJ.”Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson agreed to buy Shockwave Medical  (SWAV)  in a deal valued at $13.1 billion including debt, as the company builds its cardiac-health-centric medical devices business.More Wall Street Analysts:Analyst unveils new Nike price target ahead of big summer for sportsAnalysts weigh in on Google-parent Alphabet’s stock after cloud eventAnalysts revamp Disney stock price target after proxy fightOn April 17, Bank of America analyst Geoff Meacham lowered the firm's price target on JNJ to $170 from $180, while keeping a neutral rating on the shares.Shares traded down despite a ""solid"" first-quarter and unchanged reported guidance midpoint. The analyst told investors that Meacham suspects this was due to disappointing sales for Carvykti, a treatment for multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer, and the vision business.Johnson & Johnson finished up slightly to $145.74 on April 18.“Indeed, investors were caught off guard by the lack of sequential growth for Carvykti, which management largely attributed to ‘phasing and timing of purchase’ despite prior quarter's commentary that a sequential growth is expected,"" the analyst wrote.""Based on our conversations with investors, it's likely that Carvykti may be facing competition from bispecifics as well as other CAR-T therapies,"" he said, referring to artificial protein used to for cancer treatment.Jessica Moore, vice president of investor relations, told analysts that Carvykti's sales reached $157 million, compared with $72 million in the year-ago quarter, “driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies, and strong demand.”“While sequential growth was roughly flat due to phasing, we continue to anticipate quarter-over-quarter growth, with acceleration in the back half of the year,"" she said.Sales of its blockbuster psoriasis drug Stelara also came in lower than expected.Meacham said that he believes commercial execution from key growth franchises remains the focus and that better-than-expected quarterly performance and pipeline readouts can improve investor sentiment.The 2024 guidance looks ""beatable,"" the analyst said but he reduced his price target on a lower Carvykti sales outlook.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024"

It also sells instruments and sensors to detect leaks and deliver clean water. The other 15% comes from the flow instrumentation market, which serves the industrial sector.Badger Meter's first quarter earningsAlong with Xylem and Roper Technologies' Neptune, Badger Meter dominates the North American utility water meter market -- together, they sell ""roughly 85% of the water meters in the North American market,"" according to Badger Meter's SEC filings.The good news is that the company's smart water meter sales are surging at the moment. A 29% increase in utility water sales led to an overall year-over-year sales increase of 23% for the company in the first quarter. In the earnings release, management pointed to the ""ongoing favorable industry fundamentals, driving robust customer demand for our innovative smart water solutions.""Badger Meter's solutions are vital in reducing water waste, ensuring adequate water infrastructure, and monitoring leakage.

As CEO Kenneth Bockhorst noted on the earnings call, ""We have long stated that we didn't anticipate or count on much in the way of infrastructure or other government funding to drive growth.""Story continuesBased on that, investors shouldn't expect federal spending to move the needle much for this company in the future. Moreover, Bockhorst told investors its sales comparisons will get ""more difficult as the year progresses.""While Badger Meter doesn't give guidance, investors will be able to get more color on the likely direction of this industry when Roper reports on April 26 and Xylem on May 2 -- two dates to look out for before buying Badger Meter stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Badger Meter right now?Before you buy stock in Badger Meter, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Badger Meter wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vinfast-auto-stock-98-upside-143836460.html,"VinFast Auto Stock Has 98% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","Fri, April 19, 2024, 10:38 AM EDT","VFSWW
-0.05%","When VinFast Auto (NASDAQ: VFS) reported its first-quarter financial update this week, it had a mixed report for investors. The Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer reaffirmed that it expects to produce 100,000 EVs this year. But its first-quarter vehicle production and revenue were still a disappointment.That led analysts at investment banking firm BTIG to lower their stock price target for VinFast from $8 to $5 per share. The new price target would still represent a gain of 98% from the stock's current $2.52 price over the next 12 months or so. BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis and his team also feel the stock is still a buy.What's the future of VinFast Auto?VinFast stock has been on a wild ride since it first went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger in August 2023. After soaring to more than $80 per share, reality set in for the early-stage EV maker, and shares have since dropped to the low single digits.This week the company said it only generated about $300 million in revenue in the first quarter and it reported a higher loss than expected. While BTIG is one of only four analyst firms that cover VinFast, the expectation was for revenue of more than $400 million.But VinFast has expansion plans across the globe that it hopes will result in the 100,000 vehicle production plan for 2024. That will take a major effort since first-quarter production was below 10,000 units. VinFast has agreements with 16 new dealerships in the U.S. as it constructs a manufacturing facility in North Carolina. It hopes to increase its brand awareness as it imports vehicles ahead of the North Carolina plant's opening.The analysts think that the expansion of its dealership network and growing production capacity will allow shares to rebound from its recent level. Investors might want to take a wait-and-see approach, however. Much uncertainty, as well as a high amount of capital spending, make this stock too risky at this point in its development.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in VinFast Auto Ltd. right now?Before you buy stock in VinFast Auto Ltd., consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and VinFast Auto Ltd. wasn’t one of them.
