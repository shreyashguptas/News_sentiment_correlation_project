US yields climbed to fresh 2024 highs as the Federal Reserve chief said it will likely take longer to have confidence on inflation — adding that it’s appropriate to give restrictive policy time to work. The dollar had its best five-day gain since October 2022, while the slide in US stocks from a record deepened.Powell’s remarks represented a shift in his message after a key measure of inflation exceeded forecasts for a third straight month. He also signaled the US central bank will likely keep rates on hold for longer than originally planned, according to Jeffrey Roach at LPL Financial.“Powell’s comments make it clear the Fed is now looking past June,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore. “His remarks are consistent with ‘plan B’ as July for two cuts this year, but leave open the possibility that more sustained disappointment on inflation could deliver a more extended period of rates on hold.”Futures for the S&P 500 indicated a slight rebound after the index on Tuesday dropped to around 5,050. US 10-year yields rose seven basis points to 4.67%, while the equivalent Australian yield climbed four basis points early Wednesday. Gold held near a record high and oil was little changed as traders monitored Israel’s response to Iran’s unprecedented attack over the weekend.After starting the year by pricing in as many as six rate cuts in 2024, or 1.5 percentage points of easing, traders are now doubtful there will even be a half point of reductions. Market-implied expectations for Fed rate cuts — which have collapsed in the past two weeks — declined further after Powell’s comment on inflation. Around 40 basis points of easing remained priced in for the year.Story continues“If you were looking for bits of easing or dovish talk from Powell, you did not miss it — he didn’t give it,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities.Earlier Tuesday, Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said he expects inflation will continue to moderate with interest rates at their current level but persistent price pressures would warrant holding borrowing costs high for longer. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said some recent data, including the consumer price index, has not “been supportive” of a soft landing.Amid all the anxiety, the widely watched MOVE index, an options-based measure of expected volatility in Treasuries, spiked to the highest since January.To James Demmert at Main Street Research, rising bond yields are a sign that the global economy and corporate profits are strong and resilient. While that may result in fewer than expected or even no rate cuts for the foreseeable future, it isn’t something that will ruin the stock bull market, he said.“In the early phase of a new business cycle, it’s earnings — not the Fed — that drive stocks,” he said. “Earnings have been far better than expected and we envision a similar outcome as earnings season is once again in full swing. We are buyers of this stock market correction.”Key events this week:Eurozone CPI, WednesdayFed issues its Beige Book, WednesdayCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks, WednesdayFed Governor Michelle Bowman speaks, WednesdayBOE Governor Andrew Bailey speaks, WednesdayTaiwan Semiconductor earnings, ThursdayUS Conf.

+1.64%","Semiconductor stocks have soared over the past year amid investor mania for artificial intelligence.Graphics processing units (GPUs) are the chips that fuel AI. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index has jumped 54% over the last 12 months.Nvidia  (NVDA) , the 800-pound gorilla that dominates the GPU market for AI, has led that rally. Its shares have tripled over the period, giving it the third highest market capitalization in the country, after No. 1 Microsoft and Apple.“We are seeing a historic rise in demand for AI, accelerators, led by Nvidia,” Morningstar analysts Brian Colello and Jivyaa Vaidya wrote in a report.“In recent quarters, Nvidia has reported staggering revenue growth, raised the bar for the next quarter even higher, and then smashed through such rosy forecasts.”<img alt=""Nvidia and its CEO Jensen Huang have led the way for chips used in artificial intelligence.<p>SAM YEH/Getty Images</p>"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NjKb3OLQT6w9uav0lfxBWA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ3MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thestreet_881/6825e67425e4d4339d3b1164d31aa0bc"" class=""caas-img"">Nvidia and its CEO Jensen Huang have led the way for chips used in artificial intelligence.SAM YEH/Getty ImagesMorningstar's overview of semiconductor industryDemand for AI-related GPUs should remain strong, they said. “We still see the world’s leading cloud computing providers, and even nation states, racing to buy enough GPUs to run generative AI for themselves and their customers.”That’s true whether economic growth stays strong or weakens, the analysts said.Related: Analyst updates Nvidia stock price target after stocks tumbleHowever, “the non-AI landscape is a different story,” they maintain. “PC [Personal computer] and smartphone chip demand is recovering from cyclical bottoms in 2022-23.”As for industrial chips, “demand seems to be mired in the bottom of a downturn [this year], although firms are seeing some green shoots that suggest a recovery in the second half of 2024,” Colello and Vaidya said.Turning to automotive chips, demand for them is “the biggest question mark heading into first-quarter earnings,” the analysts said.“At best, auto chip growth will grind to a halt, if not fall modestly after three-plus years of great growth. At worst, sluggish demand for electric vehicles may drive the auto space into a deeper cyclical downturn for most of 2024.”Story continuesAnd what about valuations? As of April 1, the analysts viewed the semiconductor industry as 1% overvalued on a median price basis, according to its analysts’ fair value estimates of individual stocks.But Colello and Vaidya have a differentiated view of semiconductor industries, “Digital chipmakers appear overvalued,” they said.Related: Analyst revamps Nvidia stock price target as Mag 7 earnings loom“The rise of AI is reasonably priced into shares of industry leader Nvidia, but other AI names appear too pricey.”Still, it’s a different story with analog and mixed-signal chips, the analysts said. “Their valuations are still below our fair value estimates, as near-term automotive and industrial demand is sluggish and inventory levels continue to rise.”In terms of geography, ""European names look attractively priced to us,"" the analysts said.Morningstar’s most undervalued semiconductor stocksMorningstar offered three top picks among U.S.-listed tech stocks.1. Infineon Technologies  (IFNNY) . Morningstar fair value estimate: $50. Tuesday closing price: $34.10.The German company is in the analog and mixed-signal chips space.“We’re particularly bullish about the company’s opportunities in automotive semis, which make up over 40% of its revenue,” the analysts said. “Infineon is the worldwide leader in power semis.”More Wall Street Analysts:Analyst unveils new Nike price target ahead of big summer for sportsAnalysts weigh in on Google-parent Alphabet’s stock after cloud eventAnalysts revamp Disney stock price target after proxy fight2. STMicroelectronics  (STM) . Morningstar fair value estimate: $66. Tuesday closing price: $40.30.This Swiss company is also in the analog and mixed-signal chips space. And it too has “healthy exposure to the auto market,” the analysts said.“It’s a leader in silicon-carbide-based semis thanks to its strong partnership with Tesla and rising content in EVs with other carmakers.”3. Skyworks Solutions  (SWKS) . Morningstar fair value estimate: $133. Tuesday closing price: $99.“Its radio frequency products have enabled the world’s adoption of 4G, and increasingly now 5G, mobile devices,” the analysts said. Above all, that means Apple’s iPhones.While there’s concern that Apple’s focus on making its own chips will lessen its dependence on Skyworks, “we view that assessment as vastly overstated,” they said.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024"

Major indexes dropped last week after inflation came in hotter-than-expected in March, causing investors to dial back their expectations for rate cuts in 2024. Stocks took another hit after Iran attacked Israel over the weekend, with investors flocking to safe havens like US Treasurys.But the latest concerns may be minor blips in the face of a booming US economy and the potential uplift from artificial intelligence, meaning the bull market in stocks is still far from over, some veteran investors say.Here's why four Wall Street pros say investors shouldn't sweat over the latest pullback in stocks:Tom Lee, Fundstrat Head of ResearchInvestors should buy the dip in stocks, as the March inflation report wasn't as bad as it seems,  according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.In a recent video update, Lee noted that more components of the consumer price index saw year-over-year price increases of less than 3%. That's a promising sign that inflation is on track to fall to the Federal Reserve's 2% price target, even if prices overall for the economy came in hotter-than-expected last month.Headline inflation was mainly driven by a surge in auto insurance, he added. That suggests a June rate cut is still possible, he said, though markets have mostly taken that possibility off the table, according to the CME FedWatch tool.""Believe it or not, this was actually a very good CPI report,"" Lee said. ""It just tells you that this is a timing issue, it's not structural. In other words, nothing else is causing hotter CPI.""Story continuesJames Demmert, Main Street Research CIOStocks are still in the midst of a longer-term bull market, and the recent correction represents the latest buy-the-dip moment for investors, Demmert said.""A stock market correction is unfolding right now triggered by Middle East tensions, rising bond yields, and worries about delayed Fed rate cuts. Stocks have been due for a pullback for quite some time as it has been 6-months since we've seen a pullback of 8-10%,"" Demmert said in a note on Tuesday.The size of the pullback will depend on whether Middle East tensions continue to escalate, but even rising tensions can't derail the bull market, he suggested.""We are buyers of this stock market correction because while the headlines are scary right now, we believe we have entered a new bull market led by the power of artificial intelligence,"" Demmert said. ""This new bull market can last for another 7-9 years, as AI is expected to drive significant productivity gains for companies across the board, which will strengthen corporate earnings.""Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities analystTech stocks will keep soaring despite recent headwinds, as corporate earnings are poised to come in strong over the first quarter, Ives said.According to surveys conducted by Wedbush, consumer spending and digital advertising growth trends look ""strong"" among internet companies over the first quarter. That could be bullish for tech titans, including companies like Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta, Ives said.Wedbush is also expecting a huge wave of AI spending to boost stocks. The firm anticipates $1 trillion of AI investment over the next decade, with the second, third, and fourth wave of spending poised to hit the sector in the coming years.""We believe the recent risk-off environment and tech sell-off represent a clear buying opportunity into this upcoming tech earnings season,"" Ives and other analysts said in a note on Sunday. ""While a hot CPI, weak bank earnings, and geopolitical worries has put pressure on stocks, now the Broadway stage and bright lights are focused on a key tech earnings season ahead which we believe will be strong across the board.""John Flood, Goldman Sachs' head of Americas equities sales tradingStocks still look poised to move higher by the end of the year, Flood said this week. He pointed to a handful of positive catalysts that lay ahead of the market, including a historical post-tax season surge, rising corporate stock buybacks, and strong confidence indicated by inflows to money market funds.""There 's still plenty of dry powder out there,"" Flood said, pointing to the $1.6 trillion inflow to money market funds since 2023.Stock sentiment also isn't at extreme bullish levels yet, a promising sign that a major pullback isn't imminent, he said.Stocks could surge another 15% this year, Goldman strategists said in a previous note. That's due to ""exceptionalism"" in mega-cap tech stocks, which they predicted could push the S&P 500 to 6,000 by the end of the year.Read the original article on Business Insider"

Unfortunately, this meant quite a tough trading session for the company and its investors, as market players largely sold out of the shares. They fell by 5% in value, notably worse than the 0.2% dip experienced by the bellwether S&P 500 index.A major double whiffNorthern Trust saw declines in both revenue and, particularly, net income in its first quarter. The former declined by 6% year over year to hit $1.65 billion, while the latter saw a far steeper (36%) drop to slightly under $215 million ($0.96 per share) according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Both headline figures were significantly under the average analyst estimates. The consensus prognosticator forecast for revenue was $1.78 billion, and for per-share earnings, it was $1.45.During the quarter, the Chicago-based financial services company saw a 6% uptick in non-interest expenses. Other line items affecting its performance included a more than $184 million pre-tax loss on debt securities due to what it characterized as a ""repositioning"" of its portfolio. On a brighter note, it did see 13% in total assets under management (AUM), a key metric for many companies of its type.Management says frothy equity markets will provide supportManagement waxed positive about Northern Trust's trailing performance and immediate future, although its pronouncements didn't seem to land with investors, given the sell-off.

On news of layoffs in two major Asian markets, they traded out of the company's stock, to the point where the bank's U.S.-listed shares lost more than 2% of their value.Pink slips coming?HSBC is in the process of laying off a clutch of workers in its investment-banking operations in two of the continent's financial hubs, Hong Kong and Singapore, according to reporting from Reuters. Citing three unidentified ""people with knowledge of the matter,"" the news agency said the affected workers are mainly associates and vice presidents at the sprawling international bank.If the report is accurate, HSBC wouldn't be the first to reduce its investment banking workforce in Asia, nor is it likely to be the last. The mainland China and Hong Kong stock markets have both been struggling, largely due to structural issues in the Chinese economy. When markets are in the doldrums, investment banks tend to cut headcounts.HSBC didn't directly address the reporting in the Reuters story. An unnamed spokesperson from the bank told the news agency that, ""The size of our workforce will fluctuate in any given year.""Not a secure job these daysWhile the news isn't all that encouraging, it doesn't come as a great surprise -- likely a reason why HSBC shares weren't punished harder on Tuesday. China and the markets around it have been struggling for some time, and it was inevitable that investment banks would take a hit from this.

The dollar's strength will surely crop up in discussions between finance ministers and central bankers attending the IMF and World Bank Spring meetings.The IMF on Tuesday revised its U.S. growth outlook sharply higher, and said China's stronger-than-expected first-quarter growth may prompt an upward revision to the outlook.In theory, these are positive developments for markets in Asia. And Wall Street's resistance on Tuesday in the face of yet another spike up in Treasury yields could still inject some optimism into Asian trading on Wednesday.But that could be tempered by Middle East tensions and patchy Q1 U.S. earnings.The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is at a two-month low, having declined 4% in the last four days. Time for a pause, or is selling momentum gathering a powerful head of steam?Story continuesThe same question could definitely be asked about the Japanese yen, which is printing fresh 34-year lows on a near-daily basis.The latest Japanese trade data and Reuters 'tankan' survey of manufacturing and non-manufacturing business sentiment will be released on Wednesday, but probably won't move the yen much.In terms of domestic factors that could impact the yen, apart from direct intervention, investors will be looking to inflation figures and comments from Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda in Washington later in the week.Perhaps the highlight in a thin Asian and Pacific economic calendar on Wednesday is New Zealand inflation.A Reuters poll shows annual inflation in the first quarter is expected to slow to 4% from 4.7% in the final three months of last year. That would be the lowest since Q2, 2021.Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:- IMF/World Bank meetings in Washington- Japan trade (March)- New Zealand inflation (Q1)(By Jamie McGeever)"

However, though they have very similar names, money market accounts are very different from money market funds.In this breakdown of money market accounts vs. money market funds, learn how these savings vehicles differ in terms of returns, account minimums, benefits, and risks.What is a money market account?A money market account is a type of deposit account available from many banks and credit unions. They usually pay a higher rate of interest than typical savings or checking accounts. Here’s a look at the average rates on these common deposit accounts as of March 2024, according to the FDIC:Interest checking: 0.07%Savings account: 0.47%Money market account: 0.67%Read more: The best money market rates available todayUnlike savings accounts, money market accounts give you check-writing privileges, so you can occasionally use your account to pay bills or transfer money. They may also come with a debit card.As deposit accounts, money market accounts opened with federally insured banks or credit unions are protected against bank closures. Your deposits are backed, up to a maximum of $250,000, by either Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).What is a money market fund?Though the names are similar, money market funds are quite different from money market accounts. Money market funds are not deposit accounts; they're a type of mutual fund, an investment fund that pools money from multiple investors to invest in a basket of securities, such as stocks or bonds.Money market funds invest in short-term, liquid securities, such as commercial paper (unsecured corporate debt) or certificates of deposit (CDs). To invest in a money market fund, you must have an eligible investment account with an investment firm or online broker.Money market funds tend to be lower-risk investments than other mutual funds, and they're typically used to store cash or as an alternative to traditional stocks. As an investment fund, money market funds can have higher returns than money market accounts, but they alsoinvolve more risk.As a type of investment, money market funds are protected by Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a government corporation that protects investors who have money with financially troubled brokerages.
