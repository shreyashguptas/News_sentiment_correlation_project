Hong Kong rallied more than 2%, with measures from Chinese authorities to bolster the city’s status as a financial hub giving an added boost.Demand for safe havens eased, after traders last week were whipsawed by Middle East tensions as well as hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials indicating reluctance to cut rates anytime soon. Oil and gold both fell. The dollar was weaker while the yield on 10-year US Treasury yields advanced.“We are seeing a relief rally underway this morning as geopolitical risks subside,” said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. “The move basically squares the ledger now and allows the markets to go back to focus on macroeconomic and corporate fundamentals.”Contracts for US equities edged higher after the S&P 500 recorded its worst week since March 2023.

0.00%","(Bloomberg) -- Middle East tensions and currency volatility have caused Japan’s record stock rally to falter, but the weakness looks temporary as solid corporate fundamentals and the long-term artificial intelligence outlook provide support.Most Read from BloombergElon Musk’s Robotaxi Dreams Plunge Tesla Into ChaosTikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US ClaimsTrump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial UnderwayTesla Spends Weekend Cutting Prices of Cars and FSD SoftwareThe Fed’s Forecasting Method Looks Increasingly Outdated as Bernanke Pitches an AlternativeThat’s the view of Koji Nakatsuka, chief investment officer for Japan equity at Allianz Global Investors, which manages $2.4 trillion in assets globally. “If everything gets normalized, the Japanese stock market has an upside potential towards the end of the year. The Nikkei may return to its record high levels by year-end,” he said.Japanese stocks have come close to a technical correction after surging to all-times highs earlier this year, as traders slashed bets on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. That spurred renewed strength in the dollar and pressured the yen, which has weakened to near 155 against the greenback. It’s a level that has raised concerns on possible intervention by authorities and triggered warnings from Wall Street brokerages, at a time when rising geopolitical stress is prompting a flight to safety.It’s highly likely that the yen will weaken to 155-158 per dollar, said Nakatsuka, but “most market participants are already expecting the government to intervene, so it’s difficult to continue buying the dollar and shorting the Japanese yen.” Domestic-oriented small-cap stocks that benefit from a stronger yen will start to catch up with their bigger peers that have been leading the rally over the past year.The small-caps have more niche players with distinctive AI expertise, he said, adding that the corporate reform campaign will eventually broaden out to the nation’s smaller firms as well. An index of small-cap firms has returned just 6% over the past year, lagging the 35% return in a large-cap gauge.Story continuesAs oil prices remain elevated after touching this year’s high earlier in April given heightened tensions between Israel and Iran, growth stocks are “very vulnerable,” especially fine chemical companies that import basic material in dollar terms, according to Nakatsuka. “The input cost is so high that their profitability may be squeezed.”Meanwhile, China’s uncertain economic recovery path has triggered Allianz to trim Japanese stocks with exposure to Asia’s biggest economy starting from last year, including steel, factory automation and machinery companies. “I think that was the right decision,” he said. “It’s a structural problem and it may take a few years to recover.”Even after the Bank of Japan exited its negative interest rate policy last month, the asset manager is staying overweight in banks and developers in spite of their underperformance in past rate hike cycles. “Previously when the BOJ increased the interest rate, that was the best timing to sell banking stocks. But this time I decided to keep holding financials because the BOJ is likely to increase the interest rate again in the second half of this year,” he said.The next catalyst for Japanese stocks will be first—quarter earnings due over the next few weeks, with tech shares likely to show a better performance, he said. “Even without the depreciation of the Japanese yen, corporate earnings should be marginally positive for AI-related names and electronic component companies. And momentum for automakers is improving in the long term.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChina’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen BillionairesWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-extended-reign-delivers-stark-001514791.html,US Dollar’s Extended Reign Delivers Stark Wake-Up Call for Markets,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 8:15 PM EDT",,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s financial markets are encountering a force they didn’t bet on for 2024: A strong dollar is back and looks set to stay.Most Read from BloombergElon Musk’s Robotaxi Dreams Plunge Tesla Into ChaosTikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US ClaimsTrump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial UnderwayTesla Spends Weekend Cutting Prices of Cars and FSD SoftwareThe Fed’s Forecasting Method Looks Increasingly Outdated as Bernanke Pitches an AlternativeHaving entered the year predicting the greenback would decline, investors have been forced into a rethink by a red-hot US economy and sticky inflation requiring the Federal Reserve to hold off cutting interest rates.With the International Monetary Fund predicting output stateside will grow at twice the clip of its Group-of-Seven peers, talk of “US exceptionalism” is rife and supporting stocks and bond yields, adding to the dollar’s appeal. And in a time of mounting geopolitical strife, the currency still stands as the ultimate currency haven.Read More: Emerging Markets Are Ready for US Dollar ShockA Bloomberg dollar index has gained more than 4% this year, reflecting advances against all major developed and emerging-market counterparts. One popular gauge of trader sentiment pointed bearish at the start of the year, but has since flipped to become the most bullish since 2019, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Among those recalibrating their strategies for the dollar is the world’s second-biggest money manager Vanguard Group Inc., which is now calling for sustained strength. UBS Asset Management says the dollar has probably got further to rise despite being 20% more expensive than it’s typically valued. Meantime, Wells Fargo Investment Institute capitulated on forecasts for weakness by year-end and now reckons it will extend its climb through 2025.“If other countries can’t match the growth and inflation of the US, there’s just no other option than to buy the dollar,” said Ales Koutny, head of international rates at Vanguard. “What was a very tactical trade for us before has become much more of a long-term structural view regarding sustained dollar and US economic strength.”Story continuesThe greenback’s resurgence has come on the back of a slew of signs that the US economy swerved the slowdown many anticipated. The labor market has stayed tight and manufacturing activity continues to expand. The resulting persistence in inflation has led Fed Chair Jerome Powell and fellow policymakers to wait longer than expected to cut rates.New York Fed President John Williams has even suggested the possibility of resuming rate hikes if warranted.“At the beginning of the year I was more of a dollar bear, but that’s no longer the case,” said Rajeev De Mello, global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management SA. “Powell’s comments definitely changed things.”Of course, the surge in the world’s reserve currency inflicts a price on its counterparts and their economies, which traders are also scrambling to address. India and Nigeria are among the countries seeing their exchange rates plumb record lows, while threats of intervention are being heard from Japan to Poland.Central banks in developed markets such as Australia, the euro-area and UK may find their room for lowering rates limited if weaker exchange rates fan domestic inflation. Those countries burdened by foreign debt, including the Maldives and Bolivia, as well as those heavily reliant on American imports, may be among the most hurt.In a sign of growing anxiety caused by the greenback’s rapid ascent, the Group of Seven nations earlier this month reaffirmed their common stance over the potential damage of disorderly currency moves. It came after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged the concerns of Japan and South Korea over sharp declines in their currencies, which may offer Tokyo and Seoul more scope to defend the yen and won.High YieldsAs markets scale back bets on Fed easing, Treasury yields have soared again in recent weeks, sending benchmark yields to near 5%. The surge has been a major driver of the dollar’s appeal, which has also benefited from ceaseless inflows into US stocks amid the frenzy for artificial intelligence.“What’s unique now is that the dollar is such a high yielder,” said Peter Vassallo, portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “If you’re a global allocator and running your portfolio, what a slam dunk to improve your risk-adjusted returns: buy shorter-term US debt, unhedged.”In contrast to reduced expectations for Fed easing, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has indicated policymakers may be in a position to lower rates in June. Meantime, Japan is so far behind the US in growth that even a historic decision to end the world’s last negative rates failed to prevent the yen from hitting a 34-year low.“The interest environment in the US is just so much more attractive,” said Ed Al-Hussainy, global rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “The US dollar offers a very high rate of return.”Haven DemandAnother tailwind for the dollar is its role as an unrivaled sanctuary for investors seeking refuge at times of political or financial turmoil. The currency’s haven status was on full display Friday, surging after Israel launched a retaliatory strike on Iran less than a week after Tehran’s rocket and drone barrage.Helping to explain the dollar’s haven status is the widely-followed ‘dollar smile’ theory coined by Stephen Jen, chief executive of Eurizon SLJ Capital Ltd. Jen’s thesis is that the dollar rises when the US economy is either booming or in a deep slump, with weakness during periods of moderate growth.Heightened geopolitical risks are working together with a booming economy to create “a curlier smile, with steeper tails,” creating more of a U-shape, Jen said in an interview. “For every level of US outperformance, the dollar should be stronger, because of that safe haven premium coming from geopolitical risk.”US growth hasn’t decelerated so the dollar will stay on the “right side” of the smile for longer, he said.What Bloomberg Strategists Say...The underlying strength of the greenback will linger as long as US exceptionalism and stubborn inflation persists.Mary Nicola, Markets Live strategist“So long as the US economy is stronger than its G7 brethren, the dollar will be strong relative to other G7 currencies,” said University of California at Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen. “ Not everyone may be happy with this, but there is little that can be done about it.”The author of “Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar” doesn’t expect strength in the US currency to lead to confrontations, but does see growing debt servicing difficulties for developing countries with dollar-denominated debts.But to some observers, including Clocktower Group’s Marko Papic, US currency strength may offer a “silver lining” for Europe, China and Japan. “It would help engender a global recovery given that most of the rest of the world is export oriented,” said the alternative asset manager’s chief strategist.While the escalating tensions in the Middle East offer a fresh boost to the dollar, its strength will likely last well beyond the conflict.“I still expect the dollar will prove the ultimate winner as the knee-jerk reactions fade,” said Carol Kong, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, referring to the latest developments in the Middle East. “US energy independence and high yields are likely to keep the dollar’s appeal to investors.”--With assistance from Daisuke Sakai.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChina’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen BillionairesWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-woo-snowball-buyers-40-233000522.html,Brokers Woo ‘Snowball’ Buyers With 40% Returns After China Stock Market Rout,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 7:30 PM EDT",,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese securities firms are dangling near record-high returns to lure investors back into the market for derivatives that fueled the nation’s stock selloff earlier this year, as fallout from the meltdown cuts deeper into their profits from the business.Most Read from BloombergElon Musk’s Robotaxi Dreams Plunge Tesla Into ChaosTikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US ClaimsTrump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial UnderwayTesla Spends Weekend Cutting Prices of Cars and FSD SoftwareThe Fed’s Forecasting Method Looks Increasingly Outdated as Bernanke Pitches an AlternativeTwo “snowball” products issued last month offered coupon rates of more than 40%, a level unseen since at least 2022, according to data compiled by Galaxy Technologies. Five brokerages raised the yields on products linked to the CSI 1000 Index in March from the previous month, while six others including CSC Financial Co. joined the fray, pushing a GalaTech measure of the average price to a record high, the data show.Brokerages are fighting to win back snowball investors after the market rout earlier this year, when most products fell through levels that threatened to wipe out coupons or even impose losses. The intensifying price competition is adding to pressures on profitability as firms seek to revive sales to help offset mounting hedging losses.“A price war has started,” said Liu Fuchen, co-founder of Shanghai-based GalaTech, which also provides derivatives trading and risk management solutions to financial institutions. “The current environment certainly can’t support such high coupon rates, and securities firms will face huge profitability pressures if they keep issuing products like this.”An estimated 330 billion yuan ($46 billion) of snowballs were outstanding as of November, according to UBS Securities Co. The exotic products pay investors bond-like coupons as long as the stock index they reference stays within a predetermined range.Story continuesIf the index rises above the range, then a “knock-out” is triggered, in which the contract terminates and the investor receives the coupon for the period to date. If the index drops below the range, then a “knock-in” occurs, in which the holders receive no coupon and potentially lose part of their capital unless the index rebounds to hit the knock-out level before maturity. The longer the investors hold the product, the bigger the return — like a rolling snowball.Coupon rates in recent years have typically ranged from 10% to 20%. The products have been lucrative for brokerages, which hedge their exposure using stock-index futures and generate extra income by investing part of the proceeds. The discount of index futures, which persists in the Chinese market, often adds to the profit. The products are often distributed by hedge funds.Major SetbackBut the business suffered a major setback in the first quarter when the majority of existing products’ underlying stock indices slumped below knock-in levels. That meant brokerages had to sharply increase purchases of stock-index futures and later sell them to limit risks under the so-called delta hedge. The process exacerbated the slump and likely imposed losses on the brokerages, according to Liu.On top of that, the firms have since had to switch the hedging strategy for contracts that knocked in to the opposite just as the market started to rally in the following weeks amid government’s unprecedented intervention. The switch required them to buy more index futures when prices rise and sell when they fall to stay delta neutral, even though it’s a lossmaking proposition.That’s eating into profits of a business which, according to Kaiyuan Securities Co. estimates, contributed about 2.5% of net income at China’s listed securities firms last year. Other sources of profit from snowballs can hardly compensate for the hedging losses and still leave enough money to pay the coupons should the indices rebound further to hit knock-out levels before maturity, according to Liu. The CSI 1000 has jumped 23% from its Feb. 5 low.As a result, brokerages are facing pressure to sell new snowballs and start fresh “buy low, sell high” hedging positions, he said. “It’s their best solution. So if some very popular products with high coupons can help revive snowball sales — even though the pressures on near-term profitability are huge — they’ll be more than happy.”A Shanghai-based hedge fund manages the two highest-return snowball products sold last month, which raised about 110 million yuan. A securities firm will provide the hedging, and while the coupon rates for the first year are high — at 41.2% and 42.2% — they showed its confidence in its capabilities, according to a spokesperson for the fund. He asked not to be named or identify his firm or the brokerage, citing policies on such private offerings.Separately, CSC Financial didn’t reply to a request for comment.Boosting overall sales is no easy job, as even some experienced investors have lost faith. Sophie Yu, who works at a financial company in Shanghai, said she’s slashing her holdings of snowballs to 20% of her investments from 50%. Two products that she held knocked in in February, after her efforts to negotiate lower trigger levels with her brokerage failed.Yu said the products are designed to the disadvantage of investors because they are only given one day each month for a potential knock-out, while a knock-in can happen any day the index is low enough. Clients also should be given more flexibility such as the option to exit early with their principal by giving up the coupon, or to extend the contract’s maturity by one year when needed, she added.Only seven new snowballs were issued in the tumultuous week of Feb. 5 right before the Lunar New Year holiday, close to the fewest in a year, according to GalaTech data. The first quarter saw 133 new offerings, slumping from 383 a year earlier, the data showed.Risk AppetiteMuch of the hope lies in investors like Dora Zhong, who bought her snowball with 1 million yuan in January thinking the timing was safe enough to get a 12.5% return. The market fell further, and her product knocked in. Still, the rally in the CSI 1000 has brought her close to a knock-out, where she can pocket the return.“What’s good about snowballs is that they have clear return features — with the coupon rate much higher than bonds when market volatility is high — although it could have extreme tail risks,” Zhong said. “I would still consider buying more when the conditions are right. Even if I had to take a loss, it’s acceptable.”Brokerages are also offering revised product structures to meet investors’ changing risk appetite. They’ve been issuing snowballs with lower knock-in thresholds, and recently focused more on so-called phoenix products, which are more liquid and pay a monthly dividend as long as no knock-in occurs.When Yu Zheng, who works in the southern city of Guangzhou, bought a snowball with a descending knock-out line in May, she also thought it was safe. “I just didn’t expect a hit like that in February,” she said, adding that she’s still calm as there’s more than a year before maturity.“I would still consider suitable products, like a phoenix structure,” said Yu. “I just have no more money now.”--With assistance from Amanda Wang.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChina’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen BillionairesWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple StoreRents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US InflationThe Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-undervalued-growth-stock-down-233000129.html,1 Undervalued Growth Stock Down 79%: But Don't Buy and Hold Until You Know These 3 Risks,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 7:30 PM EDT",PYPL+0.34%Sign in to add to watchlistSign in,"The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have been on an impressive run since the start of 2023. This bullish sentiment might have investors worried that they can't find attractive buying opportunities.Yet, there are still cheap businesses to buy, and I think PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is one of them. Shares of the online payments service have cratered over the past few years and recently sat nearly 80% below their peak price. But the stock now trades at a bargain forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.3.Don't rush to buy and hold PayPal just yet. Here are three risks you need to know about with this digital payments pioneer.1. Intense competitionThe broad secular growth story of cashless transactions, coupled with how lucrative these businesses can be at scale, has drawn lots of competition to the space. PayPal deserves credit for being the first pure online payments provider, developing a strong brand known for trust and security. But things are getting crowded.Braintree is PayPal's merchant-facing solution. Its growth has been spectacular recently, with payment volume rising 30% in 2023. However, it's going up against heavyweights like Stripe, Adyen, Worldpay, and Fiserv's First Data, to name a few. Competing on price, ease of use, and product features is what Braintree tries to do, but it will have to be on top of its game if it wants to grow market share.It's the same story on the consumer side. PayPal's digital wallet has wide acceptance, but there are numerous other players focused on individuals and their needs.Apple Pay, and to a lesser extent, Alphabet's Google Pay, are digital wallet providers that should keep PayPal's management up at night. Because these dominant tech firms control the two most popular mobile operating systems, they can place their payment services ahead of PayPal's.PayPal's user base at the end of 2023 -- 426 million active accounts -- was down 2% year over year. If the business can't keep competition at bay, this key metric will continue trending in the wrong direction.Story continues2. Capital allocationDan Schulman, who was the company's previous CEO, might have squandered capital on wasteful acquisitions that weren't necessarily core to PayPal's operations. The company paid $4 billion for Honey and $2.7 billion for Paidy, to name the two biggest purchases. Schulman was also focused on building a super app that rivaled the ones found in China, a strategy he didn't follow through on.Previous leadership might have made poor capital allocation decisions. There's always a risk that the new CEO, Alex Chriss, might also follow this path. I understand that he's focused on product innovation, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. He's trying to find ways of integrating this technology into PayPal's various offerings.But if I were running the business, it would be hard for someone to dissuade me from wanting to use all the cash produced and on hand to repurchase shares. To be fair, PayPal spent all of its free cash flow on buybacks last year, with the intention of doing the same this year.The company currently has a net cash position of $6 billion. Maybe it's smart to use some (or all) of this to repurchase even more shares, particularly when the stock is trading at a dirt-cheap valuation.3. The Venmo problemIn 2023, Venmo represented 18% of PayPal's total payment volume. It's a sizable business line, but investors worry that monetization has been a challenge. I'd suspect that the vast majority of Venmo usage, which is people sending money to one another, earns no revenue for PayPal.Venmo's biggest competitor, Block's Cash App, has arguably been much more successful at monetizing its user base. Cash App has 56 million monthly active customers, and it generated $4.3 billion of gross profit in 2023. That's because it's catching on with lower-end consumers who view it as a banking substitute.A valid argument can also be made that PayPal can find a way to merge the PayPal and Venmo apps into a single consumer-facing app. They have many of the same features, anyway.Now that you understand what I think are three big risk factors, you can make a more informed decision about the stock.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This comes after Iran attacked Israel with missiles and drones that were largely repelled by Israel and a multinational coalition that included the U.S., and a retaliatory strike by Israel.""The downgrade follows what we view as a further increase in already high geopolitical risks that Israel faces in the aftermath of the first direct attack by Iran in mid-April 2024,"" the ratings agency wrote. It explained that ongoing hostilities with Hamas in Gaza, as well as threats from Iran and its Lebanon-based proxy Hezbollah have caused expectations about the duration of the conflict to continue this year.""Under our baseline scenario, we still expect a wider regional conflict to be avoided, but the Israel-Hamas war and the confrontation with Hezbollah appear set to continue throughout 2024,"" S&P Global Ratings wrote.

Further, it is expected that Hezbollah and Israel will continue to exchange fire at the northern border with Lebanon but that it won't escalate into a more direct war, and that that conflict won't widen across the Middle East. It also assumes ""there will be no substantial continuing direct confrontation with Iran and no broader instability in the West Bank.""Story continuesREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP""We currently see several possible military escalation risks, including a more substantial, direct, and sustained military confrontation with Iran.

Adjusted net income for the five supermajors combined is expected to be $28.4 billion for the first quarter, similar to the prior period as higher refining margins offset lower oil prices and earnings from gas trading. Exxon, Chevron and Europe’s TotalEnergies report results Friday, followed by Shell Plc and BP Plc in early May.SilverSilver has had a strong start this year, rising more than 20% as the white metal follows gold’s rally. Silver’s price has approached levels not seen since retail traders squeezed the market in early 2021 and is within striking distance of $30 an ounce. Record industrial usage, especially from green economy applications such as solar panels, and an ongoing supply deficit should underpin prices going forward, according to the Silver Institute. That may prompt investors to meaningfully return to silver-backed exchange-traded funds, helping push prices even higher.CornDespite all the talk about demand for US corn after 2023’s record harvest, all eyes are on the size of the Brazilian crop that’s almost ready to be gathered. Total supply coming out of the world’s largest exporter will directly impact American competitiveness. While the size of Brazilian crop is up for debate — the US Department of Agriculture projects a much bigger harvest than Brazil’s National Supply Company, known as Conab — a robust reaping could help the South American nation hold its ranking as top exporter of the grain.Story continuesLNGEurope’s demand for liquefied natural gas, which soared during the energy crisis, will likely peak this year, according to ACER, the bloc’s energy regulator. The message will be a reassuring one for European Union leaders, who were left scrambling to find gas after Russia, the region’s biggest supplier, invaded Ukraine. It also means that the US decision to halt new LNG export projects won’t be as keenly felt as many feared. Now the EU just needs to work out how to stop the last remaining pockets of Russian imports of the liquefied fuel. The European bloc is the biggest importer of LNG.Mining and ConstructionCaterpillar, whose iconic yellow machines are found at mining operations and construction sites around the world, is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. Investors will be watching for details on orders and inventories from the US bellwether, with metrics that offer insights on the health of industries underpinning the global economy.

ImagesWall Street is gearing up for the highlight of earnings season this week.Mega-cap names that make up the Magnificent Seven will begin reporting, starting with Tesla.Investors are looking for Elon Musk to soothe fears after a tough stretch, while AI will be front and center more broadly.Investors are gearing up for what's become the main event of earnings season in recent quarters, zeroing in on mega-cap firms as they unveil their first-quarter results.Despite recent dips, investors are hoping major tech giants can keep the momentum rolling, with artificial intelligence in focus as the technology continues to captivate Wall Street.""I think the next few weeks, this is a 'get out the popcorn moment' for tech,"" Dan Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg TV last Thursday, adding that this earnings period will be a ""flex the muscles moment"" for tech companies and a ""golden buying opportunity"" for investors.Excitement is high as investors look for the next catalyst to help spur fresh gains for stocks amid a dreary stretch and a sell-off sparked by still-hot inflation and geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East.Here's what Wall Street is focusing on as the first crop of mega-cap titans gets ready to report.Tesla — April 23Elon Musk's car company is causing investors a lot of stress heading into earnings, with a laundry list of woes on the radar, including a dive in vehicle sales in the first quarter, controversy over Musk's $56 billion pay package, and recent layoffs that saw the company axe over 10% of its staff.The stock is down 40% year-to-date, and a slew of banks have downgraded their outlook for the shares as it pivots from a more affordable vehicle model and toward initiatives like robotaxis and full self-driving tech.However, Wedbush's Dan Ives said he still remains bullish but emphasized that Musk must address key issues during the earnings call next week to keep investors from fleeing the stock.Story continuesThat includes explaining China's growth decline, providing clear guidance on growth, margins, and cash flow, confirming the development status of Model 2, and detailed plans for AI.Alphabet — April 23Bank of America is bullish on the Google parent heading into earnings, saying in a note on Thursday that limited job openings indicate cost management, but analysts foresee 13% upside potential above Wall Street's 11% growth estimates, thanks to robust YouTube performance.Additionally, the bank thinks highly of Google's robust search results, seeing them as the second catalyst for a recovery in AI sentiment after the March lows, especially with the Google I/O developer event still on the horizon.""AI use does pose long-term competitive risks for Google, but in 2024 Google (and peers) are likely to see AI monetization improvements,"" the note said.Meta — April 24Meta recently dropped its latest AI chatbot, Llama 3, flexing its muscles with performance over industry benchmarks with upgraded reasoning skills.JPMorgan analysts led by Doug Anmuth warned that Mark Zuckerberg's company may be headed for a slowdown after the first quarter, driven by tough comparisons and a perceived lack of fresh catalysts compared to 2023.""We believe slower growth is well-anticipated, & likely taken into account in META's undemanding multiple,"" Anmuth wrote.Even though generative AI still dominates investor chatter, the buzz is shifting towards recognizing its early wins in coding efficiencies and cost savings rather than new revenue streams and product upgrades, the analysts said.""META is an exception, w/ implementation of AI in the ad stack perceived as an important contributor to growth,"" the note said.Microsoft – April 25Microsoft is seen by Wall Street as a heavy hitter in AI going into earnings, as the company is gearing up to triple its GPU count in 2024, aiming to stack up 1.8 million AI chips by year-end.Bank of America is upbeat on the tech giant's April 25 earnings release, bumping its earnings estimate by 1%, fueled by strong performance in Azure and Microsoft 365 segments.Meanwhile, the bank kept its $480 price target unchanged, signaling a potential upside of 20% from where the stock was trading late Friday.Despite a hefty 37x projected 2025 free cash flow ratio, the bank believes Microsoft's value will remain steady thanks to the rapid growth of the AI sector, which is expected to reach $944 billion by 2027.Amazon — April 30""Amazon is our Best Idea, even as it is most owned across our coverage,"" JPMorgan's analysts wrote in the note.The bank anticipates that Amazon Web Services will be a bright spot for the first quarter.""Easing optimizations, new workload deployment, favorable comps, & very early GenAI

SmithThe ongoing stock market sell-off is close to ending, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.Lee offered five reasons why he expects the multi-week stock decline will soon reverse.""Equities had a strong first quarter 2024, so the fact that stocks are consolidating and even drifting lower is not entirely a surprise,"" Lee said.The multi-week stock market sell-off that began at the start of the month is nearing its end, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.The long-time stock bull told clients in a note on Friday that the near 5% decline in stocks over the past three weeks was a simple de-leveraging event that was likely nearing its end, setting the market up for a rebound in the short-term.""Equities had a strong first quarter 2024, so the fact that stocks are consolidating and even drifting lower is not entirely a surprise. The difference in our take, at this time, is that we do not see a larger decline ahead,"" Lee said.The decline in stocks has been driven by a one-two risk-off punch related to disappointment around recent inflation trends and growing geopolitical risk in the Middle East.But Lee ultimately expects these risks to disperse, paving the way for stocks to resume their uptrend and hit new record highs before the end of the year.These are the 5 reasons Lee believes the current stock market decline is nearing its end.1. A subdued VIXLee took solace in the fact that the VIX, which measures fear on Wall Street, has been rather subdued amid the recent stock market volatility.The VIX has remained below the all-important risk-on/risk-off level of 20 throughout the decline, even when considering Friday's 7% surge in the volatility index.According to Lee, if the VIX falls below 18, it would serve as a bullish sign for renewed upside in stock prices.2. VIX term inversionThe VIX term structure, or the difference between the 4-month and 1-month VIX futures, inverted earlier this week, and then quickly uninverted.Story continuesThe uninversion of the VIX means that ""markets see lower probabilities of a major high volatility event in the near term,"" Lee said.The last time the VIX experienced an inversion and then subsequent uninversion was in March 2023, which marked a local bottom in the stock market and was followed by a massive year-long rally to the upside.3. Accelerating lossesIt might sound counter-intuitive, but an acceleration in stock market losses over the past week could be a sign that investors' process of de-leveraging their portfolio is nearing its end.Lee highlighted that the S&P 500 saw a five-day negative rate of change of 3.6%. The S&P 500 has experienced this pace of losses seven times since October 2022, and in five of those seven times, it served as an immediate tradeable low.4. The put-to-call ratio is elevatedThe put-to-call ratio measures options buying activity of bearish puts and bullish calls, and its most recent reading shows an elevated amount of bearish activity, with investors overwhelmingly favoring buying puts instead of calls.The most recent reading of 1.13 in the put-to-call indicator represents an elevated level that in the past has served as a tradable low.Since October 2022, the put-to-call ratio hit 1.13 seven times, and six out of those seven times, it represented a bottom in the stock market.5. A technical lowLee pointed to recent commentary from Fundstrat technical strategist Mark Newton, who argues that a bottom in the stock market could appear by early next week.Newton's bullish reasoning includes the fact that weakness in technology stocks has not violated uptrends relative to the S&P 500, strength in defensive sectors like consumer staples and REITs has been lacking, and overall market breadth has held up well.Read the original article on Business Insider"

Two months ago, the cybersecurity company reported powerful earnings -- but slashed guidance, causing the stock to sell off. Palo Alto hasn't recovered much since.This might change. On Thursday, KeyBanc analyst Michael Turits lowered his price target on Palo Alto, as TheFly.com reports. Turits did say the stock is still worth about $355 per share, however, and he still rates Palo Alto Networks ""overweight.""But as a Palo Alto shareholder myself, I must admit: Turits' optimism stands on pretty weak legs.Is Palo Alto Networks stock a buy?Consider: KeyBanc's proprietary Value-Added Reseller (VAR) survey for the first quarter of 2024 revealed that half of the corporate IT departments that Palo Alto sells to are spending below their budgeted amounts on cybersecurity this year. Turits calls this number the ""lowest quarterly reading since the heart of the pandemic."" Multiple other surveys back up this view -- and indeed suggest the situation is getting worse, not better, for cybersecurity vendors like Palo Alto.Turits' conclusion: This is now ""a trend,"" and not a good one for Palo Alto stock. But if that's the case, then why recommend buying Palo Alto stock today?That's an excellent question, because the more I look at this stock (which I own), the less I like it.It's priced at nearly 40 times earnings, and the collective wisdom of the nearly four dozen analysts who follow Palo Alto is that it will grow earnings only 18.5% annually over the next five years. That works out to a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 2.1 -- whereas most value investors aim to buy for a PEG of less than 1.0.Given the rich valuation, that makes the chances of Palo Alto stock outperforming the market over the next five years look pretty slim. Add in the near-term risk of Palo Alto trying to sell cybersecurity in a historically weak IT market, and now seems like a bad time to get into Palo Alto Networks stock.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?Before you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palo Alto Networks wasn’t one of them.

A $10,000 investment in its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth a whopping $5.4 million today. But it wasn't a smooth ride. Netflix's stock endured some steep declines over the past two decades as it repeatedly transformed its business model, yet it has consistently proved the bears wrong.Some investors might argue that Netflix is running of room to grow. After all, it already owns the world's top premium streaming video platform with 269.6 million paid subscribers and has a market capitalization of $260 billion. But could this streaming video giant still generate more millionaire-making gains from a fresh $10,000 investment today?<img alt=""A couple watches TV from a couch."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xc8ArpnLFSx7ME.qMZZu4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ2Mg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/3a3912522918b7fe823250c622f4dcda"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.Netflix is still growingBack in April 2022, Netflix's stock sank to its lowest levels in more than four years. That decline was triggered by its first sequential loss of subscribers in over a decade in the first quarter of 2022.It attributed some of that decline to the Russo-Ukrainian war and users sharing their passwords, but management also admitted that the company faced stiff competition and said it would roll out a cheaper ad-supported tier to gain new users. Those strategies suggested Netflix was running out of room to grow, and that it still needed to ramp up its spending on fresh content to lock in more viewers. It suffered another sequential loss of subscribers in the second quarter of 2022.However, Netflix gained subscribers sequentially in the third quarter of 2022, and its year-over-year growth in subscribers accelerated over the past year. It also started generating double-digit revenue growth again over the past two quarters.MetricQ1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023Q4 2023Q1 2024Paid subscribers (millions)232.50238.39247.15260.28269.60Subscriber Growth (YOY)4.9%8%10.8%12.8%16%Revenue (billions)$8.16$8.19$8.54$8.83$9.37Revenue Growth (YOY)3.7%2.7%7.8%12.5%14.8%Data source: Netflix. YOY = Year over year.Story continuesNetflix attributed its accelerating growth to the expansion of its new paid-sharing plans, price hikes for its existing subscribers, currency exchange tailwinds, and robust viewership numbers for hit shows like Griselda, 3 Body Problem, and Avatar: The Last Airbender. Its number of ad-supported memberships also grew nearly 70% sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, then rose another 65% sequentially in the first quarter of 2024.For 2024, Netflix expects its revenue to rise between 13% and 15% and for its operating margin to expand from 21% to 25%. Those expanding margins reinforce its reputation as the only major streaming platform that can generate consistent profits. Walt Disney, which served nearly 150 million paid Disney+ subscribers in its last quarter, believes its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming unit can finally turn profitable by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ends this September).But how much larger can it grow?Netflix is still expanding, but it recently surprised investors by saying it would stop disclosing its paid subscriber and average revenue per member (ARM) metrics in 2025. It insists those changes reflect the expansion of its pricing tiers and the introduction of new revenue streams like advertising and paid sharing plans. However, the elimination of those key metrics could make it much harder to gauge Netflix's growth while masking the lumpier expansion of its global audience.For now, analysts expect Netflix's revenue to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 28%. But at $580, Netflix's stock doesn't look particularly cheap at 34 times this year's earnings. That's because it's still being valued as a higher-growth tech stock, rather than a slower-growth media stock.Let's assume Netflix hits those targets and grows its EPS at a respectable CAGR of 20% through 2034. If that happens and Netflix still trades at about 30 times earnings, its stock might be trading at around $3,300 per share in 10 years.That would represent a near-sixfold gain from its current price -- but it would fall woefully short of turning a $10,000 investment into $1 million. Netflix is still a solid play on the secular growth of the streaming media market, but investors shouldn't expect it to replicate its millionaire-making gains from the past two decades.Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brains-behind-turning-stanley-tumblers-183800278.html,He Was the Brains Behind Turning Stanley Tumblers Into a National Sensation. Now He's Joining Forces With a Hot Growth Stock That's Up More Than 300% in the Last 5 Years.,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 2:38 PM EDT",CROXSign in to add to watchlistSign in,"Just months ago, shoppers were camping out all night in front of Target to be the first to get their hands on limited edition Stanley Tumblers. However, a few years ago, Stanley -- founded in 1913 -- was just a stodgy brand from years gone by. But in 2020, the company brought in Terence Reilly as president, and it hasn't been the same since.Stanley reportedly went from about $70 million in sales in 2019 to $750 million in 2023, riding the coattails of its tumbler cups' success. But the difference for Stanley was clearly Reilly, not the tumblers themselves.Consider that Stanley Tumblers launched in 2016 and flopped. But under Reilly's leadership, the brand brought the cups back and used social media influence to market to an entirely new female demographic. This included swapping 100-year-old brand colors for new pastel colors. The plan clearly worked.As it turns out, Stanley wasn't Reilly's first rodeo. Previously, he was one of the architects who turned clog-style shoe company Crocs (NASDAQ: CROX) into a popular brand. So clearly Reilly has a gift when it comes to marketing products. The good news for Crocs' shareholders is that he's now back with the company and tasked with leading what's perhaps the company's largest opportunity.Crocs' virtuoso comes homeOn April 16, Crocs announced that it had appointed Terence Reilly as its president for its HEYDUDE shoe brand. In the press release, CEO Andrew Rees said: ""I am confident he is the right person to lead the HEYDUDE Brand into its next phase of growth.""Crocs acquired the HEYDUDE brand in February 2022 for $2.5 billion, taking on a $2 billion loan to do it. It hasn't necessarily been a bad acquisition per se, but it hasn't exactly been a resounding success either.In 2021, HEYDUDE generated around $600 million in annual revenue. In 2023, the brand had revenue of $949 million. Therefore, it's grown under Crocs' umbrella. That said, HEYDUDE's revenue slipped 4% year over year in 2023 (on a pro forma basis), which is concerning.Story continuesThe slip in HEYDUDE's revenue is concerning for another reason. One of the reasons Crocs stock is up more than 300% in the last five years is because the company has some of the best operating profit margins in the shoe business. In 2023, the adjusted operating margin for the Crocs brand took another step forward, from 33% in 2022 to over 36% in 2023. In contrast, HEYDUDE's adjusted operating margin fell from 31% to 25%.Therefore, not only are sales falling for HEYDUDE, it's also getting less profitable. This could suggest that the brand is losing its place in the market, and it's consequently not able to price its products where it wants.This is a huge opportunity for CrocsThere have been more devastating failed acquisitions than I can count among public companies during the last several years. Fortunately, Crocs' acquisition of HEYDUDE won't be that bad even in a worst-case scenario. In fact, the company repaid nearly $700 million of its debt in 2023 alone because it still generates tons of cash flow, even with the HEYDUDE headwind.Therefore, HEYDUDE won't be an insurmountable setback for Crocs if things go wrong. But on the flip side, this could be an enormous opportunity if Reilly can reinvigorate the brand, as he did with Stanley.Even after the huge gains for Crocs stock, it still trades firmly in value territory at less than 10 times its trailing earnings.<img alt=""CROX PE Ratio Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hpcpWN1xwAuGpaj6FKCbBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQzMg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/459e08febec34d511923898737286169"" class=""caas-img"">CROX PE Ratio ChartThe Crocs brand generates roughly three times as much annual revenue as HEYDUDE. If, hypothetically, Reilly can help grow HEYDUDE into something that rivals Crocs over the next five years or so, then the company's overall profits would be significantly higher.Crocs has a cheap valuation today, which mitigates downside risk for investors right now. But the Crocs brand is still growing, and the HEYDUDE brand is now helmed by someone capable of orchestrating a viral-growth story. Both of these factors provide investors with ongoing upside opportunity.This is exactly why I believe Crocs stock is still a buy today: The downside is likely limited, but the upside potential could very well be better than the average performance for the S&P 500.Should you invest $1,000 in Crocs right now?Before you buy stock in Crocs, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Crocs wasn’t one of them.

AMZN
NVDA","Making long-term predictions is difficult. Who would have guessed 10 years ago that Nvidia would be one of the largest companies by market cap in the world? Very few.Despite this uncertain future, I still believe it is useful for investors to look out five to 10 years and think about what companies could be much larger than they are today. Otherwise, you are just making shots in the dark and should probably buy index funds instead.While not a certainty, I think ""Magnificent Seven"" giants Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) will be the two largest companies in the world by 2030. Here's why.1. Amazon: Put everything in the cloudAmazon's culture of innovation has allowed it to win in multiple large product categories. Most of us know it as the dominant e-commerce platform in North America, which brings in hundreds of billions in annual sales. But it is not the most profitable segment for Amazon today: That distinction goes to Amazon Web Services (AWS).AWS is the largest cloud infrastructure provider worldwide, bringing in $91 billion in revenue and just under $25 billion in operating income last year. Its major competitors are Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and other smaller providers, but AWS has remained the largest cloud service since its inception around two decades ago, with around 31% market share.Even though AWS is already large, there is still plenty of room for the cloud to gain market share versus legacy computing solutions. Analysts expect the industry to grow at a 19% rate through 2030. If AWS can maintain its market share and profit margin profile, that will lead to the division to grow its earnings at 19% a year and hit over $90 billion in 2030. Add in the monster e-commerce division, international expansion in places such as India, and moonshots like the Project Kuiper internet service, and I think Amazon has a good chance of being one of the two largest companies in the world by 2030.Story continues2. Alphabet: Multiple levers for growthAnd who will the other be? Well, all we need to do is look at one of Amazon's cloud computing competitors.<img alt=""GOOG Operating Income (TTM) Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1mEbekGYknYX.eTYbXhP8A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQzMg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/083c83b693fd8f6c8873ed40e420a63c"" class=""caas-img"">GOOG Operating Income (TTM) ChartAlphabet is the parent company of Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and other projects like self-driving company Waymo. Google Cloud should see the same growth benefits as AWS, growing from a $36 billion annualized revenue rate at the end of 2023 to close to $100 billion in revenue by 2030. That should generate a lot of value for Alphabet, but it's not the only ace up its sleeve.First, we need to highlight Google Search and how much revenue it generates. The dominant search engine worldwide generated $48 billion in revenue just in the fourth quarter of 2023 and should do $200 billion in annual sales within a few years. As the key advertising engine for many industries like travel, insurance, and financial services, Google Search revenue should grow along with global GDP as more of the world starts using smartphones and the internet.Let's not forget YouTube. Alphabet owns the largest video platform worldwide, which generated $9.2 billion in advertising revenue last quarter. YouTube has billions of users around the world and is the most popular streaming video service on TVs in the United States. Yes, that is TVs in the United States, not all devices.YouTube is a growing entertainment mainstay for people around the world. I think it will be even more dominant in 2030.Last year, Alphabet generated $85.7 billion in operating earnings. With so many growth levers to pull, it seems likely that the company will continue growing its earnings over the next few years. By 2030, I think this will lead the Magnificent Seven giant to pass the likes of Apple and Microsoft and become one of the two largest companies in the world alongside Amazon.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Here Is 1 Stock That Could Dominate.","Sun, April 21, 2024, 2:22 PM EDT",PATH-1.52%Sign in to add to watchlistSign in,"Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are advancing so quickly, it's getting harder to imagine a world in which the technology isn't impacting just about every facet of daily life.While much of the chatter surrounding AI has revolved around areas such as accelerated computing and healthcare, there's another use case that's piqued my interest. Integrating artificial intelligence into the corporate workforce represents a unique and compelling long-term opportunity.Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has declared that AI software has the ability to significantly increase productivity in the workplace. In a recent report, Wood suggests that AI automation software could be a $13 trillion market in 2030.Believe it or not, there are a host of companies focusing on building more efficient workplace environments through the power of technology. UiPath (NYSE: PATH) is a leading player in AI-powered automation tools, and I think it could be the best investment option in this pocket of the AI realm.Let's break down how AI can redefine workplace dynamics and assess why UiPath is a compelling long-term opportunity.Workplace productivity is ripe for disruptionBringing efficiencies to basic tasks is not a new idea. In many cases, technology has been the key to unlocking these gains.In Ark Invest's Big Ideas 2024 report, Wood presents some interesting case studies related to robotics and how they've enhanced completing mundane and administrative aspects of labor.For example, Wood says that the advent of the washing machine cut down the average time to do laundry by 87%. Similarly, integrating assembly lines into factories significantly reduced the time needed to manufacture a car.These ideas have been applied to the workplace for decades. For example, sales and marketing leaders have relied on customer relationship management (CRM) tools from the likes of Salesforce for many years.Moreover, enterprise resource planning (ERP) suites from SAP and Oracle have facilitated some of the largest businesses in the world when it comes to aggregating financials, analyzing operating metrics, and more.Story continuesAccording to Wood, by automating tasks through artificial intelligence, the average worker's productivity could increase by 4.5x. If all of the potential software vendors captured just 10% of the productivity gain, Wood posits, these companies could reap $13 trillion in combined revenue.This scenario implies that UiPath has a greenfield opportunity as it relates to the intersection of AI and workplace productivity. Let's dive into how the company is actually performing, and how it stacks up against the competition.<img alt=""An artist's rendering of a humanoid robot with their finger on their chin."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sGZMY05eFSxxFHWXKlMI3w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTUwMg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/bb78ffecf25afb79ee5abe1ed9c1e048"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.UiPath is leading the chargeUiPath operates in the robotic processing automation (RPA) market. Essentially, the company's software helps automate administrative tasks and boost workflow processes.UiPath ended last year with over 2,000 customers spending at least $100,000 per year on its platform. Moreover, UiPath increased its customer count by 26% year over year for those spending at least $1 million per year on its software suite. This highlights UiPath's deep penetration in both small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) as well as larger corporate accounts.The accelerated customer adoption isn't entirely surprising given how much demand for AI has risen over the last year. The company increased revenue by 24% last year to $1.3 billion. Meanwhile, adjusted free cash flow was $309 million. By comparison, the company was essentially breakeven on a free-cash-flow basis during the prior year.With an impressive partner ecosystem that includes SAP, IBM, Accenture, PwC, and Deloitte, I think UiPath's growth story is just getting started.A compelling valuation narrativeThe chart below benchmarks UiPath against a cohort of other enterprise software platforms that offer workplace productivity solutions. With a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.4, investors can see that UiPath is positioned right in the middle of this peer set.<img alt=""PATH PS Ratio Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XPLZ3x5qxyZzdMc9Z_IVog--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTU2Mw--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/c19ec2949a7aa56b897df8ad9e19ad8e"" class=""caas-img"">PATH PS Ratio ChartWhat I find most interesting about the analysis above is that UiPath is valued more in line with the larger tech behemoths operating in the RPA space -- with Microsoft being the lone exception. Given the success Microsoft has demonstrated through its CoPilot platform, it's not entirely surprising to see it trading at such a noticeable premium among this peer set.Keep in mind that UiPath ended last year with about $2 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Although the company is cash-flow-positive, one item to consider is how the company will allocate its resources. In order to compete with big tech behemoths at scale, UiPath will likely need to increase spending.While that would impact the company's bottom line, it could be a worthwhile strategy. I'm optimistic about the efficiencies that AI can bring to the workplace in the long run, and am aligned with Wood's theory that the market opportunity is enormous.So far, UiPath has proven that it can compete in the RPA market against larger and better-capitalized enterprises. Given how fast AI is impacting other important end markets, I think it'll be sooner rather than later that the technology will begin to make serious impacts on workplace environments.I think now is a good time to consider scooping up shares in UiPath as productivity becomes more of a focal point for businesses of all sizes.Should you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?Before you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UiPath wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-trillion-dollar-stock-2030-180600889.html,Will Oracle Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 2:06 PM EDT",ORCL,"Shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) have underperformed the broader market in the past year, rising a modest 25% while the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has clocked gains of almost 45%. However, the provider of database and cloud services provider has shot into the limelight of late thanks to artificial intelligence (AI).Last month, investors cheered Oracle's results from its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended Feb. 29. The database specialist not only delivered better-than-expected numbers, but also revealed a solid improvement in its revenue pipeline thanks to the growing demand for its AI solutions. However, will Oracle be able to capitalize on the AI opportunity, beat the broader stock market in the long run, and become a trillion-dollar company by 2030?AI could accelerate Oracle's growthIn Oracle's fiscal 2018, it reported $39.8 billion in revenue. The company is expected to finish fiscal 2024 in a few months with a total revenue of $53.2 billion. That translates into a six-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6%. For the current fiscal year, Oracle is expecting a 6.6% increase in revenue.However, Oracle's top-line growth rate is expected to improve over the next couple of years, hitting 10% in its fiscal 2026.<img alt=""ORCL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.E50opem1StJJMKo4pFxOg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTM3Mg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/c4d642d11e9755cba2412ae05b58f96e"" class=""caas-img"">ORCL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year ChartThe growing adoption of cloud-based enterprise AI applications could help accelerate Oracle's growth beyond fiscal 2026. That's because the market for cloud-based AI services is set to grow rapidly from an estimated revenue of $43 billion in 2022 to a forecast $887 billion in 2032, according to researchers at Valuates Reports. The good news for Oracle investors is that this market has started moving the needle in a nice way for the company.In its fiscal third quarter, Oracle generated $9.96 billion in revenue from its cloud services business -- an increase of 12% from the prior-year period. The segment now accounts for 75% of the company's total revenue compared to 72% in the year-ago quarter. However, this business's growth pace looks poised to accelerate, as Oracle's remaining performance obligations were up an impressive 28% year over year to $80 billion.Story continuesOracle attributed this sharp increase to the ""[l]arge new cloud infrastructure contracts"" it signed during the quarter for its AI-focused Gen2 cloud infrastructure. It is worth noting that Oracle is witnessing stronger-than-expected demand for its Gen2 AI cloud infrastructure. That rising demand, which is outstripping its capacity, explained CEO Safra Catz in the earnings release, is why the company is ""opening new and expanding existing cloud datacenters very, very rapidly.""Oracle's focus on building and expanding its data center infrastructure should eventually help it make the most of the cloud-based AI market in the long run. But will that be enough to lift Oracle into the trillion-dollar club?What the long-term picture may look likeAs mentioned, Oracle's revenue is expected to increase to $63.6 billion in its fiscal 2026, with the company exiting that year with a growth rate of just over 10%. Assuming Oracle's revenue continues accelerating and it can clock a CAGR of 12% over the five fiscal years that follow, its top line would jump to just over $112 billion in its fiscal 2031, which will end in mid-2030.The companies in the U.S. technology sector average a price-to-sales ratio of 7.1. Assuming Oracle trades at a similar multiple in 2030, its market cap would then be about $796 billion. Now, that would be short of the $1 trillion market cap milestone, but it also suggests that Oracle stock could rise by 140% from current levels in that time frame. Moreover, if Oracle manages to clock faster growth thanks to its AI-related businesses, it could get closer to $1 trillion, or even exceed it.Finally, as the company is trading at 6.5 times sales right now -- a discount to the tech sector's average -- buying this AI stock looks like a no-brainer. Oracle seems built for robust long-term upside thanks to its improving AI credentials.Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

-0.92%
^GSPC
-0.88%","In the past decade, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index have produced total returns, including dividends, of 225% and 323%, respectively. These gains prove that investing in the stock market is a fantastic way of building wealth.Unsurprisingly, some companies have fared much better. Your mind might immediately go to the dominant ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, which is understandable.But it might shock you to learn that O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY), a leading aftermarket auto parts retailer, has seen its shares skyrocket 657% in the past 10 years, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $75,000 today (as of April 17). Should you hop on the bandwagon and buy this winning stock?Creating value for shareholdersInvestors will find no shortage of reasons why O'Reilly Automotive is such a wonderful company. There's no doubt that these positive attributes have contributed to its stock's performance.For starters, the business continues to benefit from meaningful expansion opportunities. O'Reilly currently has 6,157 stores after opening 186 in 2023. The plan is to open 195 more this year. The industry is extremely fragmented, giving the company plenty of opportunity to lean on its scale and brand to gain market share.There are two other powerful industry trends that will keep propelling O'Reilly. One is the fact that each and every year, the number of cars on the road goes up. Moreover, these vehicles are getting older, which leads to greater demand for O'Reilly's products and services.Speaking of demand dynamics, investors will appreciate how recession-resilient this company is. Consumers need their cars to work no matter what, whether we're in good or bad economic times. This situation drastically adds stability and predictability to the business model.From a financial perspective, O'Reilly has been able to steadily increase its top and bottom lines. In the past 10 years, revenue and diluted earnings per share have risen at compound annual rates of 9% and 20%, respectively. Given the factors I just outlined, there's a good chance this kind of performance can continue for the foreseeable future.Story continuesEven after investing capital toward opening more stores, O'Reilly generates more cash than it knows what to do with. That's why management aggressively repurchases shares, spending $3.2 billion to buy back the stock in 2023. In the past five years, the outstanding share count has been reduced by a jaw-dropping 26%. This means longtime investors constantly see their ownership stakes rise over time. What about the valuation?After a business puts up an outstanding 657% return in the past decade, investors are right to wonder if the shares still present a compelling buying opportunity. It's best when a stock is purchased below its intrinsic value, as the potential for outsized forward returns is still present and expectations haven't gotten too frothy.As of this writing, shares of O'Reilly trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.4. This is about as expensive as the stock has been in the last eight or so years. And it represents a sizable premium to the trailing five- and 10-year average P/E multiples. So you can make a valid argument that shares are overvalued right now.Investors might be persuaded to wait for a much better entry price. That makes sense as a rational way of thinking, but perhaps the best strategy if you're bullish on this business is to dollar-cost average in the stock over several months. This will allow you to buy at multiple entry points.Given the superior quality of O'Reilly, it could be a winner in your portfolio over the next several years.Should you invest $1,000 in O'Reilly Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in O'Reilly Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and O'Reilly Automotive wasn’t one of them.

One budding area in the AI realm that big tech firms are exploring right now is voice-recognition software.""Magnificent Seven"" members Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia are all investing heavily in AI-powered speech.Yet despite big tech's pursuit of this technology, a smaller player has made headlines this year. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) specializes in voice-recognition software for the restaurant, automobile, and smart home industries.Earlier this year, shares of SoundHound AI soared following news that Nvidia is an investor with the company.Although the stock has retreated from its peak levels, it's still up over 80% year to date. When you compare that to the 3% return of the Nasdaq Composite, you might be wondering if SoundHound AI can be a million-dollar opportunity.AI-powered voice technology is an enormous marketThe market for voice-recognition technology could reach $50 billion by 2029, according to Statista. Considering this tech can be integrated into vehicles, smart-home appliances, and various business settings, it's easy to see why so many of the world's largest enterprises are pursuing the technology.Moreover, venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) that voice represents the ""front door"" to the next phase of the AI revolution.Palihapitiya could be onto something here. Over the last year or so, the world has become captivated by the rise of ChatGPT. Its creator, OpenAI, recently announced the company is exploring applications in AI-powered speech.Given the potential size of the market and the number of high-profile companies competing, it's intriguing that such a small-scale player like SoundHound is receiving so much attention.SoundHound AI is in the spotlight but ...Though Nvidia published the 13F filing disclosing its investment in SoundHound in February, it has been an investor with the company since 2017. This was before SoundHound went public, and it was raising funds from venture capital firms and prominent tech giants.Story continuesIn 2023, SoundHound AI grew revenue 47% to $45.9 million. Moreover, the company reduced its operating losses by 51% -- reporting negative adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $35 million.The growth is attractive, but it doesn't fully explain the triple-digit gains the stock has seen at various points in 2024.Can investing in the company make you a millionaire?For illustrative purposes, I'll assume SoundHound sustains its 2023 growth rate through 2030 to project future sales. By doing so, the company would generate roughly $680 million of revenue by 2030.The stock also trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of about 18 as of this writing. Considering there is a lot of competition entering the voice-recognition market, and the company's path to profitability is unproven, I'll trim its long-term P/S multiple in half to 9.These assumptions result in a future market capitalization of $6.1 billion for the stock. This is roughly 5.5 times its current market cap of $1.1 billion, which means you'd have to invest more than $180,000 to get to $1 million.Not only is that a lot of money for any single position, but there are risks for SoundHound that make any significant investment particularly dicey.The table below breaks down consensus analyst estimates for SoundHound's revenue through 2025:Category2025 Estimate2024 Estimate2023 ActualRevenue$102.8 million$69.5 million$45.9 millionData source: Yahoo FinanceOn the surface, the growth trends in the table above are in line with the assumptions I made above. However, alarm bells went off when I noticed a change in terminology on SoundHound's reported financials.Specifically, management updated how the company accounts for its backlog, which now includes ramped-up deals with clients that aren't guaranteed. The details in company filings further indicate that SoundHound is recognizing sources of non-recurring revenue in any given quarter, but management is classifying these transactions as royalties and subscriptions in its financials.This makes it hard to get a sense of SoundHound AI's true, normalized revenue profile. Therefore, forecasting the company's growth is an even more daunting exercise.Given the risks around hyped-up, small, and unprofitable companies, I think the stock is more of a momentum play.

That's exactly what Costco (NASDAQ: COST) has done for its investors.In the past 30 years, shares have returned 13,300%, including dividends. That gain would have turned a $10,000 investment into more than $1.3 million today (as of April 16). This performance absolutely crushes the S&P 500.To gain a better appreciation for what Costco has accomplished for investors, it's worthwhile to look at its history. Then, with a fresh perspective, we can determine if this unstoppable retail stock makes for a no-brainer buy right now.Scaling up the businessCostco's business model hasn't changed over the years. About 30 years ago, the company operated 200 warehouse locations, generating $15 billion of net sales in fiscal 1993. Costco currently has 876 warehouses open, raking in $238 billion in net sales in fiscal 2023.This has been a story about a business that has scaled up its operations in a tremendous fashion. Three decades ago, the company's executive team figured out that low prices on high-quality merchandise in a no-frills shopping environment are what every customer wanted. So, they invested aggressively in expanding domestically and internationally. It's a repeatable and proven playbook that is still in force today.The result of this strategy has been rising sales and earnings. This business is consistently profitable, giving it the ability to pay one-time special dividends every few years. The most recent payout of $15 per share was announced last December, boosting investor returns.Costco is currently the world's third biggest retailer, behind only Walmart and Amazon. It has 73 million member households that pay annual fees to have the right to shop at the company's warehouses. This helps generate a predictable and recurring high-margin revenue stream.A company that has become as dominant as Costco benefits from some competitive strengths. In this case, the business possesses a powerful scale advantage. Because it buys merchandise in such massive quantities, it is able to obtain favorable pricing on goods, savings that are constantly passed on to customers.Story continuesEven with the rise of online shopping, Costco has been able to open new locations, grow revenue and net income, and add new members. This makes me believe that the company's competitive position is insulated from the threat of disruption, whatever that may look like.Past results don't resemble forward returnsAs of this writing, Costco carries a market cap of $316 billion, which makes it the world's 29th most valuable business. Add this to its monster sales base, and I'm positive that forward returns aren't going to come anywhere near what they've reached in the past.There's still growth potential. Costco was able to open 23 net new warehouses in fiscal 2023, with management expecting 28 more in  the current fiscal year. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, the company is projected to grow revenue at 6% per year on average over the next three years.These would still be healthy gains. But it's safe to say that Costco's expansion potential isn't as large as it once was.The valuation is also worrying. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 46.6. They've rarely been more expensive in the last 20 years. While the business has a dominant position in the retail sector, the stock is likely to disappoint going forward given its nosebleed price tag.It would be easy to argue that paying that type of valuation makes sense. However, that's only if you believe Costco will be able to grow at a faster clip in the next five to 10 years than it did in the past. I just don't think that's a probable outcome. Therefore, I'm not a buyer of the stock right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beaten-down-growth-stock-become-170000613.html,Can This Beaten-Down Growth Stock Become a Trillion-Dollar Company by 2050?,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 1:00 PM EDT",PTON-0.98%WatchlistWatchlistWatchlistRecommendation RatingHold,"In order to get better and learn new lessons, it's a good idea for investors to study history. These insights can be applied to new investment opportunities you might be looking at.Perhaps no business has presented a more informative case study than Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON) in recent times. The fitness industry innovator was on an impressive growth trajectory before the pandemic, a trend that was supercharged when people were stuck in their homes during the health crisis.That rise was spectacular. But Peloton's fall from grace, as evidenced by the share price that's 98% below its peak, is even more unbelievable. Despite the company's ongoing struggles, I'm sure there are still fervent Peloton bulls who hope better days are coming.With that being said, can this beaten-down stock become a trillion-dollar company by 2050? Here's what you need to know.Getting back into shape, and then someAs of this writing, Peloton sports a market capitalization of $1.2 billion. If the company reaches a valuation of $1 trillion by 2050, it implies a monster 833-fold gain, which translates to a 30% annualized increase. Before you immediately roll your eyes, I think it's worthwhile to figure out what Peloton would need to do to achieve this milestone.For starters, the core business needs to not only get back on solid footing, but growth needs to pick up. Selling significantly more exercise bikes and treadmills will be key, but sales of equipment were down year over year in the last three months of 2023. Getting more people to sign up for Peloton's digital app membership is also important.Moreover, Peloton must start to produce positive earnings and free cash flow. The business has failed to post net income in any fiscal year. Getting to this milestone is the management team's priority.When Peloton was on top of the world, growing revenue north of 100%, its market cap peaked at close to $50 billion in January 2021. Shares traded at a price-to-sales multiple of more than 20 around that time, too. If the core business can get back to producing the kinds of financial results it did back then, it would be an encouraging development, but I'm not sure if the market cap will exceed that previous peak of $50 billion.Story continuesThis means that for the company to get to a $1 trillion valuation, it needs to find ways of significantly expanding its total addressable market. Maybe Peloton will start designing, manufacturing, and selling fitness wearables, like the Apple Watch, Whoop, or Oura ring. Or maybe it will open up a chain of fitness studios across the country and internationally.These are at least related to the company's exercise equipment offerings. And they can cater to a bigger audience.Be realistic about PelotonTo really move the needle, though, Peloton would need to get into completely different industries that possess much greater expansion potential. I can think of health insurance because it goes with the health and fitness focus. Streaming entertainment is another one that comes to mind, given that Peloton shows live and recorded classes and because music is such a big part of the experience.But even the leaders in the health insurance and streaming industries aren't close to a $1-trillion market cap. And if Peloton somehow decides to enter these markets, the chances of success are slimmer than zero.To believe Peloton can reach this $1 trillion target requires some pretty extreme bullishness surrounding the current business's viability, as well as hope that it successfully taps new markets. That's not rational thinking.To be clear, I believe this lofty goal won't happen. Based on the company's ongoing struggles, investors should avoid the stock at all costs.Should you invest $1,000 in Peloton Interactive right now?Before you buy stock in Peloton Interactive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Peloton Interactive wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-buy-2024-161300655.html,Is Amazon Stock a Buy in 2024?,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 12:13 PM EDT","AMZN
Watchlist","Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a significant winner over the last two decades, generating enormous wealth for its investors.But for investors who have yet to buy the stock, is it too late now to add Amazon to their portfolio? Here are three questions to ask to answer that question: Is it a good business? Does it have good prospects? And is the stock price attractive?Is Amazon a good business?There are many ways for investors to evaluate a company's business model. Here are two elements to assess: customer captivity and barriers to entry.Customer captivity relates to the degree to which customers are loyal to a particular company or brand, making it difficult for them to switch to competitors. For Amazon, its customer captivity is reasonably high for several reasons.<img alt=""Lady browsing ecommerce website"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sB5zXtThUliu.MHP5V_ZLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ3MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/15c2f233190352a40f85d5758fafd7d1"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.Take e-commerce, for example. Amazon is the largest e-commerce platform in the U.S., offering the most extensive selection of products at attractive prices. This makes it easy for customers to find almost anything (at attractive prices) on Amazon without using a second platform. Besides, Amazon's extensive delivery network makes it very convenient (and fast) for customers to receive their orders. Customers in metro areas can receive a broad range of items the same day they order them.Layering on top of all the above is Amazon's Prime membership, which allows customers to pay a reasonably affordable fee and get a wide range of benefits, such as free delivery, streaming services, exclusive deals, and other perks. With more benefits added over time to Prime, customers have no reason to change their online shopping provider, especially once they have built the habit of shopping on Amazon.The next aspect is to assess the barrier to entry for competitors to grab market share from Amazon. Here again, Amazon scores well for several reasons. For example, Amazon is the largest e-commerce platform in the U.S. (with 37.6% market share), giving it an enormous scale advantage over its competitors and new entrants. This scale advantage allows Amazon to get very attractive prices from purchasing and operate at the lowest unit operating cost (thanks to operating leverage), which helps it maintain its low-price strategy.Story continuesBesides, Amazon's massive investment in infrastructure and technology over the years -- in operations, logistics, and others -- helps it provide one of the best (if not the best) online shopping experiences. Recreating such an infrastructure would take competitors years (if not decades) and colossal capital.In short, Amazon's high customer captivity and enormous barrier to entry position it as the dominant e-commerce platform in its key markets, one that's difficult for anyone to replace.What are Amazon's prospects for the coming years?Amazon has been an outstanding growth stock in the past, but that will not be useful to new investors unless it continues to grow. The good news is that there are good reasons to be optimistic about Amazon's prospects in the next few years.Let's start with cloud computing, Amazon's other major business after e-commerce. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a 31% market share worldwide in the cloud infrastructure market. Like its e-commerce sibling, AWS enjoys a scale advantage, which it passes on to customers at low prices. It's difficult for newcomers to offer the breadth of services at prices low enough to lure away customers, mainly due to the high switching costs of changing providers. Still, there is a competition risk from existing tech giants -- like Microsoft and Alphabet --that will grow their market share over time at the expense of Amazon since these companies are also actively growing their cloud businesses. However, given the vast tailwinds ahead, which include the ongoing migration to the cloud and the development of artificial intelligence (AI), there are enough growth opportunities for multiple players to flourish.Similarly, Amazon's e-commerce business still has a long way to go despite its significant online market share since its total market share in the U.S. retail market is less than 10%. It can rely on the ongoing increase in e-commerce penetration and offline store expansion to grow its retail market share in the long run. Besides, it can depend on overseas expansion in emerging markets like India to keep its growth machine spinning.In other words, Amazon (despite its huge size) can continue to grow in the foreseeable future.Can investors buy the stock at a reasonable price?An investment analysis is never complete until investors consider the stock's valuation. The focus here is to ensure they are not overpaying for a stock, regardless of the quality of its underlying business.While endless valuation tools are available, investors can opt for simple metrics. The idea is just to be roughly right rather than be precisely wrong. For example, using simple ratios like the price-to-sales (PS) ratio shows that Amazon's current PS ratio of 3.4 is around the average level for the last five years. That ratio reached a low of 1.7 and a high of 5.6 in the previous five years.So buying Amazon's stock today, while it doesn't provide any discount to investors, is probably still acceptable considering its business's quality and ongoing prospects.Investors with strong conviction and a long-term horizon (of at least three years) can consider adding Amazon's stock to their portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

It's an interesting concept, noting that Elon Musk's SpaceX has a similar service called Starlink. The good news is that if you believe in AST SpaceMobile's story, you have plenty of time to buy it. Just don't forget that there's some bad news here, as well.There's plenty of time to buy AST SpaceMobileFrom a stock price perspective, there's no reason in the world to believe that investors have missed out on AST SpaceMobile. The shares are down nearly 50% over the past year and they have fallen 85% from their all-time highs. This is not a situation in which a company's stock has rocketed higher and buying it risks buying into a Wall Street fad.<img alt=""A person jumping between cliffs, one with past written on it and the other with future."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WyLpsJEy1jvwNdAUbE_jyw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ3MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/79e35b4288c15f99cc338fc928031256"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.From a business perspective, 2023 was an important year for AST SpaceMobile. In late 2022 the space-themed company launched a test satellite. In 2023 it used that satellite to prove that it could really provide the space-based cellular broadband service that it said it could. It is currently working on five satellites that it hopes to transport to a launch site in July or August 2024. Once at the site they will await a launch window to get them up into space. Once there, AST SpaceMobile may actually have, in a limited way, a service to sell.So, from a big-picture perspective, AST SpaceMobile is only just walking up to the starting line with regard to its business. And that could be a great time to buy the stock for more aggressive investors. Conservative investors should probably stay on the sidelines, though. There are still very big hurdles to overcome before the company has a sustainable business.Being early with AST SpaceMobile means taking on big risksFrom an investor's point of view, AST SpaceMobile has a good idea, but it doesn't yet have a functioning service it can sell. Buying the stock today isn't getting in on the ground floor, it is getting in while the company is still digging out the hole in which it will pour the foundation. Simply put, you are early to this race if you buy the stock right now. A lot could still go wrong.Story continuesOne critical component of AST SpaceMobile's business model is to partner with existing telecom providers, like AT&T and Vodafone, using cellphones that are already being sold in the market. The satellite service is meant to be an add-on offering, so that AST SpaceMobile will start out with a large addressable market. It can also tap its partners for capital, which it has already done. Whereas Starlink has chosen a model in which it is basically going it alone, AST SpaceMobile's approach seems to come with less risk.And yet, AST SpaceMobile is nowhere near the point where it can offer a fully functioning service. It has one test satellite in orbit and just five on the factory floor. Even if those five were in orbit, too, the service wouldn't be fully up and running. The company's 10-K talks about a first goal of setting up a 25 satellite array and, of course, the need for more capital.At the end of the first quarter, following a capital raise from partners in early 2024, the company had roughly $211 million in cash on its balance sheet. Given that the company is ramping up satellite production and that it had total operating expenses, pulling out depreciation, of around $168 million in 2023, it looks like AST SpaceMobile has roughly a year or so of cash before it has to start asking for more money. Financially speaking, AST SpaceMobile is walking a tightrope. If it fails to raise new capital for any reason the story here could quickly come to an end.AST SpaceMobile: Being early means taking on extra riskGiven the moribund price of AST SpaceMobile you have not missed the opportunity to buy the stock, assuming you believe in the story behind the service it one day hopes to provide. But that's the rub; AST SpaceMobile is just a good idea right now, it doesn't actually have anything to sell. Buying it means taking on the very real risk that it fails to build out the satellite network it needs to start selling a service. Indeed, purchasing the stock now means taking on material financial and execution risks, which is probably only appropriate for aggressive investors who are also true believers.Should you invest $1,000 in AST SpaceMobile right now?Before you buy stock in AST SpaceMobile, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AST SpaceMobile wasn’t one of them.

Watchlist
HRL","If you are the type of investor who likes to buy certain stocks when everyone else is selling them, then you will probably find Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) and Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL) interesting. The problem with investing when there is so-called ""blood in the streets,"" however, is making sure that you're not buying a company facing a very real risk of dying. With that backdrop, deciding whether to buy Beyond Meat or Hormel is quite simple.Beyond Meat just isn't making any moneyBeyond Meat came to the attention of Wall Street as one of the first stand-alone companies to sell meat alternatives. Its products quickly became a hit among consumers and restaurants, which are always trying to draw in customers with hot new products. But, like all fads, the allure of Beyond Meat's health-conscious and vegan-friendly products eventually waned. For example, in 2023, the company's U.S. consumer volume declined 26.4%, while volume in the food service channel dropped an even steeper 30.2%.<img alt=""The words safety first with a person giving a thumbs-up sign."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/W3JVlPK6f7Dsl9Y9GcIKFw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTM3Mw--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/892ea1f8a8eb2b640141d2f36eea4074"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.The good news from 2023 is that volume grew massively in foreign markets, with consumer volume outside the United States up 3.5% and food service volume rising a huge 59.6%. Still, those gains didn't fully offset the U.S. decline, leaving the company's overall volume down by 8.1% for the year. It is also important to note that in many foreign markets Beyond Meat is a new product. If the demand trends in those markets follow the U.S. example, the future is not going to be bright.Simply put, Beyond Meat is a troubled business. And it has yet to make a consistent profit. As the trailing-12-month EPS chart below shows, it almost broke into the black on a trailing basis back in 2020. Still, recent earnings results have been nothing short of abysmal. In 2023, the company lost $5.23 per share, which was actually an improvement! In 2022, the loss was $5.75 per share.<img alt=""BYND EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e3j0GqdIgK7fjaL9bvl1Jw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQzMg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/e09bff9bfa7f13bda01153d094b7d0d0"" class=""caas-img"">BYND EPS Diluted (TTM) ChartTo be fair, the company is trying to turn things around. Cost-cutting and product innovation, among other things, are on the table. But until Beyond Meat is reliably profitable, only the most aggressive investors should consider it, because there's a real possibility that it just doesn't have a sustainable business model. Most will be better off investing elsewhere.Story continuesHormel has problems, but it is consistently profitableHormel is a much older company than Beyond Meat. In fact, it is a Dividend King, with 58 years of annual dividend increases behind it. Beyond Meat couldn't even consider paying a dividend given its weak financial results. And that's exactly the reason why most investors will be better off buying Hormel today despite the fact that it is facing headwinds of its own.To get the bad news out up front, Hormel has had a harder time than its peers in passing its rising costs on to consumers. Avian flu has been a big problem for the company's turkey operations. It bought Planters just as the nut segment of the snacking market was starting to weaken. And China's recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns has been a big drag on its foreign growth plans.These are all very real problems that investors need to monitor. And collectively, they seem pretty scary. But if you take each of them individually, they are likely to be solved in time. Hormel has a long history of successfully navigating the consumer staples market. Indeed, this Dividend King has muddled through hard times before over the last half-century and still managed to continue rewarding investors. It seems reasonable to give the company the benefit of the doubt this time around.In fact, even with the headwinds it faced, Hormel managed to earn $1.45 per share in fiscal 2023. And it is worth noting that the fiscal first quarter of 2024 saw volumes increase across all of its major lines of business, which hints that management is slowly starting to steer the ship in the right direction.Hormel's outlook is betterAt the end of the day, Beyond Meat is something of a one-trick pony, and that trick doesn't look very good.Hormel is much larger and more diversified. The larger company will probably survive this rough patch, while Beyond Meat’s problems are more serious and could potentially drive it out of business.Hormel's near-term headwinds could actually be setting up a value opportunity for long-term dividend investors, because the stock's 3.3% dividend yield is near the highest levels in the company's history. Furthermore, Hormel increased its dividend by roughly 3% in January, a clear sign that management is confident about the future even as it deals with its current troubles.So if you're choosing between these two food stocks, Hormel appears to be the more prudent choice. Beyond Meat just can't match its attractive dividend yield and long history of financial resilience.Should you invest $1,000 in Beyond Meat right now?Before you buy stock in Beyond Meat, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Beyond Meat wasn’t one of them.

The Dutch company is the largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, and it's the only supplier of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems.All of the world's top foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- use ASML's EUV systems to produce their smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips. ASML monopolized this market by perfecting its EUV technology over the past three decades, and it's already rolling out its next generation of ""high-NA"" EUV systems to help those foundries produce even smaller and more powerful chips.<img alt=""Two overlapping silicon wafers."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Zhs4fLGzllUxK1mTfTqWGQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ3MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/e101ce0aa92f92273e3ceaf226176709"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.ASML's dominance of this key technology made it a no-brainer play on the long-term growth of the semiconductor market. From 2018 to 2023, its revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% -- even as the chip sector weathered two cyclical downturns and a global pandemic -- and its annual gross margin expanded from 46% to 51.3%. That margin expansion was driven by its rising shipments of EUV systems, which cost about $180 million each and require multiple planes to ship. Its latest high-NA systems cost a whopping $380 million apiece.ASML's stock has already risen nearly 350% over the past five years and boosted its market cap to about $380 billion. But could it nearly triple and reach a trillion-dollar valuation by the end of 2025?ASML expects its growth to stall out in 2024In 2023, ASML's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) rose 30% and 41%, respectively. But at the end of the year, it warned that it would generate nearly flat revenue growth in 2024. Two challenges will cause that near-term slowdown.First, the U.S. and Netherlands are making it difficult for ASML to sell its systems in mainland China, which accounted for 26% of its revenue in 2023. The U.S. government already pressured Dutch regulators to bar ASML from shipping any of its EUV systems to China, but ASML continued to ship its older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems -- which are used to manufacture larger and less advanced chips -- to Chinese chipmakers.Story continuesBut this January, Dutch regulators revoked some of ASML's licenses for shipping its higher-end DUV systems in China. In response to those threats, many Chinese chipmakers ramped up their orders of ASML's DUV systems in the second half of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 -- but those orders will dry up throughout the rest of the year. ASML can still sell its lower-end DUV systems in China, but it expects the export curbs to reduce its total sales to China by 10% to 15% this year.Second, ASML expects high interest rates and other macro headwinds to cause its top customers -- including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- to rein in their spending on big EUV upgrades throughout the first half of 2024. That's why its total EUV bookings declined 60% year over year in the first quarter of 2024.On the bright side, ASML reiterated its outlook for stronger growth in the second half of the year. For 2024, analysts expect its revenue to stay flat as its earnings dip 5%. But for 2025, they expect its revenue and earnings to grow 29% and 57%, respectively, as the macro environment improves and it ramps up its shipments of its latest high-NA EUV systems.Will ASML join the trillion-dollar club by 2025?ASML's stock would need to rally more than 160% to about $2,350 by the end of 2025 to boost its market cap to $1 trillion. But at its current price of about $900, ASML's stock still can't be considered a bargain at 45 times this year's earnings.Looking ahead, analysts expect ASML's revenue and earnings to grow 10% and 18%, respectively, in 2026. Assuming it matches those estimates, exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and euro hold steady, and its stock still trades at 45 times forward earnings, its price could reach $1,600 by the end of 2025. That would represent a near-80% gain from its current levels -- which suggests its recent post-earnings drop is a buying opportunity -- but it wouldn't join the four-comma club.Should you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?Before you buy stock in ASML, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

That need for more power is fueling rapid growth of data centers across the country, which are pressuring the nation’s already strained power grid.“Data centers not only facilitate AI, but they're the backbone for our industries, for our commerce, for our transportation, for our health. These are mission-critical infrastructure. So it's going to be important that while we're facilitating this new industry, it's not lights out for the existing industries,” ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox told Yahoo Finance.The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates global electricity consumption from data centers could jump from 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh in 2026, roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan.That's a potential boon for power generation producers like Bloom Energy (BE), according to Byrd. He told Yahoo Finance the fuel cell company is among a group of firms “well positioned to serve the rapidly growing power needs of the GenAI enablers.”“The stock has not done well, and yet that's the type of technology that can allow data center developers to very quickly get new centers operational,” Byrd said. “The time it takes to get powered up is absolutely critical, and it's incredibly valuable economically ... Bloom Energy's fuel cells can be deployed in 50 days.”Story continuesDuring Bloom Energy’s earnings call last quarter, CEO KR Sridhar told analysts he sees AI data centers as the company’s “single biggest segment” for growth in the next decade.“The sales funnel for this sector alone is massive, not in the megawatts but in the gigawatts,” Sridhar said.Beyond the maker of fuel-cell electricity generators, other independent power producers, including nuclear plant owners, are also poised to grow from the data center buildout ahead.Bank of America research analyst Paul Cole sees Constellation Energy (CEG), Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG), Vistra (VST), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Dominion Energy (D) among the “clear beneficiaries'' of the increase in power demand.While AI’s energy use has soared in the past year, Wall Street pros tell Yahoo Finance the industry is still only scratching the surface when it comes to power consumption.“GenAI growth, in terms of electricity growth, is going to be about 100% a year for many years to come. As the cost of compute drops, new use cases show up, so the demand for compute is only going to go up and up. We're extremely early days in this dynamic, and now investors are starting to look across what I think of as the value chain to providing the power to these data centers,"" Cole added.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bargain-priced-homebuilder-stock-just-150700724.html,This Bargain-Priced Homebuilder Stock Just Raised Its Guidance. Is It a Buy Now?,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 11:07 AM EDT",DHI-2.53%WatchlistWatchlistWatchlistRecommendation RatingBuy,"For those hoping for relief on the mortgage rate front, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had some bad news earlier this week.Powell, who had said in March that the central bank was still on track for three rate cuts this year, warned that inflation was not coming down as expected. He said that ""Recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence"" that inflation is coming down, and hinted once again that rates would stay higher for longer unless inflation started falling again.If you're a prospective homebuyer or even a seller, those comments are likely a disappointment. The housing market continues to be frozen by the rate-lock effect. Homeowners who got a low mortgage during the pandemic's height are reluctant to sell and take on a much higher mortgage rate, and elevated mortgage rates mean that's unlikely to change.However, it is good news for one set of companies. Homebuilders like D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), the U.S.'s largest homebuilder, are likely to benefit from a continued higher-for-longer interest rate regime. Homebuilders have been filling the supply gap as existing home sales have fallen to near-30-year lows. There's also an estimated shortage of 4 million homes in the U.S., which should help fuel demand for D.R. Horton's services even if mortgage rates come down.That's one reason why the stock looks like a buy. Another was on display in the company's recent earnings report. Let's take a closer look.<img alt=""Worker looking at blueprints in front of home under construction."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YW3EX7IICeUfHYBcipA.2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ3MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/b934eb53d57dbc27b38e38f269d4585b"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.D.R. Horton shines againThe U.S.'s largest homebuilder continued to benefit from pent-up demand for new homes. Revenue rose 14% in its fiscal second quarter to $9.1 billion, which was well ahead of estimates at $8.27 billion.On the bottom line, net income jumped 24% to $1.2 billion, giving the company a profit margin of 13.2% in a seasonally slow quarter. On a per-share basis, D.R. Horton reported earnings of $3.52, up 29% from the quarter a year ago as it benefited from share buybacks. That figure also easily topped estimates at $3.06.Story continuesOther key metrics also showed the business growing at a steady pace. Homes closed increased 15% to 22,548, and sales orders, an indicator of future revenue, rose 14% to 26,456.Sales orders also grew in all six regions, showing demand is broad-based. Growth was especially strong in the Southwest, where orders were up more than 50% as the company moves beyond its historical base in the South.Finally, D.R. Horton also expects the momentum to continue, as it raised its revenue guidance for the year. It now expects revenue of $36.7 billion to $37.7 billion, up from a previous range of $36 billion to $37 billion, implying a revenue increase of 4.9% at the midpoint.Is D.R. Horton a buy?Investors mostly shrugged off the results. The stock closed Thursday up 0.1% after opening with stronger gains.The market seems to be skeptical that D.R. Horton can keep growing, as the housing market is volatile and homebuilder stocks got crushed by the housing crash in the great financial crisis. However, the company's balance sheet looks rock solid now with roughly $24 billion in net tangible assets, which compares to a market cap of just $48.4 billion.The stock also looks like a bargain on a price-to-earnings basis, trading at a valuation of less than 10. Estimates are likely to go up after it raised its guidance and put up a strong beat on the top and bottom lines. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton is also steadily buying back stock with plans to repurchase $1.6 billion this year, reducing shares outstanding by 3% to 4%.The latest comments from Fed Chair Powell also signal that mortgage rates could remain elevated through the rest of 2024, pumping more demand for D.R. Horton's homes and filling its coffers.With a cheap price, solid growth prospects, and excellent cash flow, the stock looks like a great buy right now.Should you invest $1,000 in D.r.

Here's why Exxon is in favor with investors, and why the rally has more room to run.<img alt=""A person wearing personal protective equipment climbing a ladder in an industrial setting.

But energy is part of the broader theme that earnings growth is driving the more value-oriented parts of the market.Resilient to high interest ratesOil and gas prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Despite high inflation and rising interest rates over the last few years, demand has been strong, which has made oil a cause of inflation -- not a victim. This characteristic is especially important since the Fed has yet to begin cutting rates, and hot inflation data is leading some economists to expect fewer rate cuts in 2024 than initially projected.Over the last few years, Exxon has used its outsized gains to pay down debt, which helped reduce its interest expense even as interest rates rose.<img alt=""XOM Net Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/S_h0x6ggjhkAuXTa9Pg.TQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTUyOA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/acaa6bc3d57b3fa5b29592861683b1b1"" class=""caas-img"">XOM Net Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) ChartExxon has been able to fund its operations, capital expenditures, dividends, and buybacks from the gains of the business, not by taking on debt or depleting the balance sheet of cash. In sum, Exxon has been resilient to higher interest rates because it has been paying down debt and not taking on new debt, and because it doesn't depend on debt to run its business (at least when oil prices are relatively high like they are today).Story continuesBy comparison, many companies investing heavily in renewable energy aren't profitable right now due to an industry-wide downturn.The key takeaway here is that an oil and gas company like ExxonMobil is attractive to investors because it is raking in the cash, enjoys impeccable financial health, has a variety of ways it can reward investors, and can do well even if interest rates stay high for longer than expected. By comparison, companies that are taking on debt or have high interest expenses are more vulnerable to interest rate risk.The long-term levers Exxon is pulling are reinvesting in the business, low-carbon initiatives, and making acquisitions. In contrast, the shorter-term levers are buybacks and dividends -- which have been substantial, as Exxon has increased its dividend by 9.2% and reduced its share count by 6.3% over the last five years.Exxon's path to the half-trillion markFor Exxon, it looks like it's a matter of when, not if, it will hit a half-trillion market value. We'll learn more about Exxon's results so far this year when it reports Q1 earnings on April 26. The stage is set for Exxon to have another great year.In its April short-term energy outlook, the Energy Information Administration said it forecasts Brent crude oil prices to average $89 in 2024, including $90 in the second half of this year. This is a great setup for Exxon, which needs to be able to justify increased spending, as well as its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources -- a $59.5 billion deal it expects to close in Q2 2024.The simplest way for Exxon's market value to go up is for earnings to grow. With the balance sheet in good order, Exxon can use outsized profits to improve the investment thesis, whether that's with accelerated growth, a higher dividend, or more buybacks. Exxon's 3.2% dividend yield is already attractive, but it is a step below where the yield has been in recent years simply because Exxon's stock price has outpaced the growth rate in its dividend.Another factor to watch is Exxon's investments in low-carbon efforts. It has been aggressively investing in carbon capture and storage, including the completion of its $4.9 billion acquisition of Denbury in November of last year. Exxon's rapidly growing Low Carbon Solutions business is a great way for the company to diversify its earnings and hedge against a gradual decline in oil demand and the energy transition. However, Exxon has made it clear it isn't just investing in low carbon for the favorable press -- it is doing so to make money.In its Corporate Plan, published last December, Exxon said it expects to generate 15% returns on lithium, hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage investments. Exxon has several emissions reductions targets for 2030, as well as an ultimate goal of being net-zero by 2050. It's a significant advantage to have the cash needed to take risks and invest in low-carbon without jeopardizing the performance of the core business.Exxon is a reliable choiceOil prices are notoriously hard to predict, so if they come down for an unforeseen reason, Exxon's earnings will be under pressure, which could weigh down the stock. Regardless, Exxon has the portfolio and fundamentals to create value for patient shareholders.Investors looking for quality, dividend-paying companies that aren't overpriced could consider Exxon and its 13.4 price-to-earnings ratio as a balanced buy now.Should you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?Before you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ExxonMobil wasn’t one of them.

XOM","When it comes to investing in the stock market, more risk does not always mean more reward. Indeed, the opposite is often true. The strongest businesses tend to be the least risky stocks to buy as they can help you avoid losses and generate lasting gains.To aid your search for these wealth builders, here are two steadfast dividend stocks that are particularly attractive buys today.1. MicrosoftIf strong balance sheets and breathtaking profitability are your cup of tea, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) will no doubt appeal to you. The tech titan is one of the safest stocks you can buy in the market today. However, don't let that fool you into thinking its days of impressive growth are over.Microsoft's brilliant decision to invest billions of dollars into ChatGPT-maker OpenAI thrust it to the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The deal accelerated Microsoft's efforts to infuse generative AI and other advanced machine learning technologies into its popular productivity software. The company's AI-powered ""copilots"" are helping customers be more efficient while also enhancing the quality of their work.Additionally, Microsoft stands to benefit from the soaring demand for cloud computing services. AI is often built in and delivered from the cloud. Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure platform is thus seeing its expansion accelerated by the rapid adoption of AI services, with revenue up 30% in the quarter ended Dec. 31.Microsoft's earnings, in turn, could more than double to $24 per share by 2029, according to Morgan Stanley. The investment bank sees the software giant's sales growing by 14% annually in the coming years, fueled by strong demand for its AI solutions and cloud computing services. Higher profits should mean larger dividends and bountiful total returns for investors who buy shares today.2. ExxonMobilHedges can help you protect your portfolio from threats. One such threat is the potential for geopolitical conflict in the Middle East and Europe to send oil prices sharply higher. Surging energy costs tend to slow the global economy and can lead to lower stock prices for many businesses. One way to hedge against these risks is to buy shares in oil-producing companies -- and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is one of the best in the business.Story continuesExxon's vast network of exploration, production, and refining operations helps to supply the world with dependable and cost-effective energy. For its efforts, the oil and gas behemoth earned $36 billion in profits in 2023.Not one to rest on its laurels, Exxon is working to expand its asset base by acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources for roughly $60 billion. Pioneer's prized acreage in the Permian Basin should boost Exxon's oil production in the coming years.Looking even further ahead, Exxon sees a multitrillion-dollar opportunity for its carbon management solutions. The company is investing in the promising field of carbon capture and storage, a potentially game-changing technology that could enable an array of industries to slash their emissions.With oil and gas fueling its near-term profits and carbon technology set to power its long-term expansion, investors can safely expect Exxon to further its impressive streak of cash payout increases.

Since its March 1986 initial public offering, the stock has risen nearly 4,500-fold.That growth would not have occurred had the company not redefined itself over time. When Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, its Windows-driven dominance had weakened amid the rise of the smartphone and competition from Apple on the PC side. So Nadella redefined Microsoft as a cloud company, ushering in a new era of prosperity and making it the company with Wall Street's largest market capitalization.Here's how the company got there -- and where it could go from here.Microsoft's growth in the Satya Nadella eraNadella took the helm at Microsoft on Feb. 4, 2014. During his tenure, the stock rose dramatically, so much so that its market value now exceeds $3.1 trillion. That dethroned Apple, the longtime leader in this regard. This move rewarded shareholders handsomely, and a $10,000 investment made on Nadella's first day as CEO would now be worth about $114,000.<img alt=""MSFT Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bctG9nOWr7nAuGMBjKBGXQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQzMg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/6da0827ec3fdb2fd6bcc18d08e46c05e"" class=""caas-img"">MSFT ChartMicrosoft before NadellaNadella joined Microsoft in 1992 and had most recently served as executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise group. In that role, he took the company into cloud infrastructure and services.When he became CEO, he took over from longtime CEO Steve Ballmer, a confidant of co-founder Bill Gates. Microsoft stagnated under Ballmer's leadership. During that time, the release of the smartphone caught the company entirely off guard.Consequently, a $10,000 investment made when Ballmer became CEO in 2000 would be worth just over $6,700 when he stepped down in 2014, leaving many investors pessimistic about the company.Nadella's approachUnder Nadella, the paradigm shifted in a positive direction. He redefined Microsoft's lead business around the Azure cloud platform. He was enormously successful, and Azure eventually became the second most-popular cloud platform after Amazon Web Services, which pioneered this industry.Story continues<img alt=""Cloud Infrastructure Providers by Market Share, Q4 2023."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/npiIblqZyFiQ0k_O2.DqOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTcwNQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/9f129fdd8247000b8813a39b339d3bb0"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Statista.That ranking in the cloud means the company plays a crucial role in supporting AI. It partnered with OpenAI, and thanks to improvements in ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing search engine poses the first real challenge in decades for Alphabet's Google Search, which has long dominated that field.This stands in contrast to Apple, which has not released a game-changing product in years and hasn't stood out in the cloud or AI despite its vast resources. Nadella has capitalized on the situation, allowing Microsoft to become one of the ""Fab 4"" companies, emerging as the largest and arguably most important tech giant.Amid its successes, the stock is up almost 50% in the last year alone. However, that takes its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 37, a level near five-year highs. While that does not necessarily derail the long-term growth story, it could discourage interest in the stock over the near term.Where Microsoft goes from hereDespite the valuation, investor returns under Nadella's leadership likely are not finished. Thanks to his guidance, Microsoft is again a leading company among the largest tech stocks.As the company leverages its cloud competitiveness and OpenAI partnership, long-term growth should continue even if the stock price is modestly ahead of fundamentals. Hence, those who invested in Nadella's leadership should probably continue to hold -- and possibly consider adding shares should the stock experience a bear market pullback.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Watchlist
TSLA","Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) hit an all-time intraday low of just $8.26 per share on April 16, following an 8% slide on April 15. Many electric vehicle (EV) stocks sold off heavily in response to news that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was cutting 10% of its workforce. Rivian followed suit later last week with its second job cut of the year, though it was a much smaller 1% reduction.With sentiment toward EV stocks declining seemingly every day, investors may be wondering what it will take for the industry to bottom, and if Rivian is a buy now that the growth stock is down over 60% year to date.<img alt=""A person puts their hand on their forehead and looks down at their phone in a stressed manner. "" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/i8LyCYF5pXb1YYyjntB8cw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ3MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/6c865369a3142f71272cc7e6f14b3dbb"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.The Tesla problemLike it or not, Tesla is the leading EV company, so its performance has ripple effects throughout the industry. Tesla's growth has slowed due to weakening demand and cost-cutting efforts intended to boost interest in EVs amid heightening competition from other EV makers, as well as hybrid options from Toyota and others.To make matters worse, there are rumors that Tesla is abandoning its Model 2 lower-priced EV offering in favor of going all-in on its robotaxi idea. We may have to wait to hear from Tesla on its April 23 earnings call to see if this news is true or not, but it would change the investment thesis since a sub-$30,000 EV was supposed to mark the next evolution in Tesla's product offering.The move seems to indicate that making a lower-priced EV isn't worth it, possibly due to a lack of demand or the cost model just not adding up. Tesla has also halted deliveries on the Cybertruck due to an accelerator pedal problem.All told, it's not a good look when the top EV maker could take its business in a different direction, maintain its established lineup of vehicles, and not pursue a lower-cost option. It bodes particularly poorly for Rivian, which is trying to branch into the lower-cost vehicle market with its $45,000 R2, with deliveries expected to begin in the first half of 2026.Plugging holesDespite all the bad news, Rivian has fairly straightforward objectives. It's focusing on the energy transition through commercial and passenger EV offerings that cater to a spirit of adventure and performance, with the intent to gradually reduce the entry-level price of its vehicles to tap into a wider audience. To get there, it has established a strong brand identity and purpose, and has to scale production, which will help make fixed overhead costs less damaging to its profitability.Story continuesThe challenge with building an investment thesis for a company like Rivian is that so much is based on what the company could become rather than what it is today. Rivian has received positive (and often perfect) performance and safety reviews for its vehicles. But it can't control the cyclicality of the auto industry, or consumer excitement toward EVs.Higher interest rates have also come at a terrible time for Rivian, which continues to burn through cash at a breakneck pace. The company is confident that it can fund operations through 2025 with existing resources, but it is still unlikely to be profitable by 2025 or even 2026, meaning it will likely have to rely on capital markets.With so much uncertainty regarding the timetable for Rivian's profitability, how it will get more cash, and what demand will look like for its existing lineup before the R2 comes out in 2026, it's understandable that some investors are dumping Rivian stock in favor of other opportunities.When an excellent business experiences a tough time, investors can rely on fundamentals like a strong balance sheet or proven business model. But that's not the case with Rivian. Although Rivian is becoming more established with the success of its products, its capital-intensive business model has so far been too much, too fast, and has left the company in an existential cash crunch.Grasping at strawsOn the surface, Rivian looks like a deep value play -- its market capitalization is $8.6 billion, but its cash and cash equivalent position is $7.9 billion. But the company intends to use that cash within the next two years, with uncertain results to show for it. The situation puts a ton of pressure on the R2, and leaves next to no margin for error.For many investors, patience has seemingly run out on Rivian stock. Even so, there's no telling how far it could fall from here. Therefore, Rivian is only worth investing in if you believe in the company's innovation, that the R2 will be well received by consumers, and that the company will have a successful capital raise -- whether that's through the debt market or equity market.Rivian is a good lesson on why an exciting company can sometimes be a terrible stock, and why growth companies must chart clear paths to profitability or risk punishment by the public markets.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

Each has placed a price target of $15 or higher on the stock with the belief that Sportradar currently offers at least 50% upside over the next year.Whether or not it happens over the next 12 months, I believe these analysts will be proven correct over the only time frame that matters -- the long term. Here's why.Sportradar: Powering the quickly growing sports betting industryAccording to Polaris Market Research, the global sports betting industry will grow 12% annually through 2030 to nearly $200 billion. As a critical ""picks and shovels"" provider to this burgeoning market, Sportradar looks well-positioned to capitalize on this undeniable megatrend.Here are the company's three customer groups and the solutions it provides for each:Betting operators: By serving sportsbooks such as Caesars, MGM, and DraftKings, Sportradar's managed trading services platform provides real-time data (play-by-play info), odds, and stats. Additionally, the company offers audiovisual content, such as graphics that overlay live betting odds onto a sports broadcast, enabling frictionless real-time betting.Sports leagues: Sportradar is an intermediary between sportsbooks and sports leagues, holding data and media rights with the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball (among many other international leagues). The company provides integrity services to the leagues to combat corruption and match-fixing and offers various fan engagement tools.Media companies: Sportradar offers streaming services for events that may not typically have standard broadcast coverage in certain areas. In addition to the video content itself, the company provides data-driven insights that broadcasters and streamers can use in graphics and delivers various advertising solutions.Story continuesThis three-sided network leaves Sportradar well-positioned to capitalize on various network effects as it grows stronger with each new betting operator, sports league, or media company that joins. A perfect example is Sportradar's recent exclusive data partnership with the NBA, which significantly increased commercial deals with Caesars Sportsbook and BetMGM, as they rely upon this data.Thanks to the synergies provided by these network effects, the company's sales have grown by 20% or more in each of the last three years. Despite these impressive figures, Sportradar's most robust growth may still be ahead.In addition to landing the NBA deal (basketball is the most bet-upon sport in the U.S.), the company bought data and streaming rights from The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for the next six years. Tennis is the second-most bet-upon sport globally. Powered by these new sports leagues and a fledgling U.S. betting market that could still quadruple in size by the time it matures, Sportradar's growth story could still be in its early chapters.The cherry on top for investors? In addition to management guiding for another year of 20% sales growth in 2024, the company appears to have finally hit an inflection point on profitability and could become a cash machine over the long haul.<img alt=""Person looking at betting site on smartphone."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/igZ6McS6F_nNH2xd5ReBlg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ3MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/5acaca128731b66a9f97bf388c634b39"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.Turning the corner on profitability and positive cash generationIn 2023, Sportradar delivered breakeven profitability and positive free cash flow (FCF) generation simultaneously for the first time in its publicly traded history.<img alt=""SRAD Profit Margin Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EXywGXFgGxSVjaUb0mBOLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ0Nw--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/f3176dc4cd708c290072db3d7ce53769"" class=""caas-img"">SRAD Profit Margin ChartWith management laser-focused on buying sports rights with a clear path to an outsize return on investment, the company has finally reached a tipping point in achieving self-sufficiency. To highlight this point, consider Sportradar's impressive cash from operations creation compared to its capital expenditures (most of which consist of sports rights purchases).<img alt=""SRAD Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/G0vAPMMo.ahOkSG5j5aE3A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ0Nw--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/aff294dc044066145087308bd4477104"" class=""caas-img"">SRAD Cash from Operations (TTM) ChartThe positive FCF generation (cash from operations minus capital expenditures) creates a natural flywheel effect for Sportradar as it grows. As FCF levels increase over time, the company will have more available cash to buy new rights with, generating more FCF from a more robust network, and so on.This budding FCF generation also gave management the confidence to initiate a new $200 million stock buyback plan. Accounting for roughly 7% of the company's total market capitalization, these buybacks could generate immense value for shareholders. With Sportradar shares trading at a reasonable 30 times next year's earnings, considering its historical (and expected) 20% sales growth rates, management is not-so-subtly hinting that it believes the company's shares are undervalued.With management and analysts agreeing that Sportradar's shares are cheap, it looks like a top growth stock to consider as a critical provider to the rapidly growing sports betting industry.Should you invest $1,000 in Sportradar Group Ag right now?Before you buy stock in Sportradar Group Ag, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sportradar Group Ag wasn’t one of them.

It all started when the pandemic hit in 2020, sending its already high growth rate to the stratosphere. Revenue jumped by 90% in 2020, and by 54% in 2021.As its revenue rose, losses expanded sharply, too. Its net loss more than doubled from $697 million in 2019 to $1.5 billion in 2021. However, that was acceptable for investors since they could see Coupang was investing heavily to acquire new users and improve its logistics infrastructure. They also expected its hyper-growth trajectory to be the new normal.But the company's growth arc quickly shifted in 2022 as consumers largely resumed their brick-and-mortar shopping habits. That year, its revenue grew by just 12%. Investors were shocked and, understandably, sold off the stock.Beyond that growth slowdown, there were other issues that Coupang had to deal with at this point. One of those was the rapid decline in the availability of easy money due to rising interest rates. This impacted all high-growth but loss-making tech companies such as Coupang. For example, Sea Limited -- the leading e-commerce company in South East Asia -- pivoted from a growth-at-all-costs strategy to one that emphasized survival and self-sufficiency. Coupang had to do the same.Besides, investors also shifted their focus, moving away from loss-making businesses with potential and toward profitable and well-established companies. So Coupang had no choice but to change course to prove that its business model was sustainable (and could be profitable).Story continuesFortunately, Coupang's move -- while resulting in slower revenue growth -- produced one huge positive: a massive decline in losses, which fell from $1.5 billion in 2021 to $92 million in 2022. The e-commerce business performed even better in 2023, growing revenue by 18% and reporting a $1.4 billion net profit.Positioned to grow profits from hereCoupang reached a massive milestone in 2023 by proving its business model could be profitable at scale. Better still, there are good reasons to expect the company to keep growing its profitability for the foreseeable future.The main driver of profitability growth will be revenue growth. While Coupang is already the largest e-commerce platform in South Korea, with a 25% market share, its share of the country's overall commerce market is less than 5%. Thus, it could rely on attracting new users and growing its existing users' wallet share to expand its market share over time. For instance, the tech company has leveraged its infrastructure and consumer base to launch new services like online groceries, food delivery, streaming, etc.Even if it has exhausted its domestic opportunity, Coupang can still grow its overseas business thanks to its investment in the Taiwan market. While these efforts are still in their early days, this investment has demonstrated encouraging user and revenue expansion results.Another vital aspect of Coupang's ongoing profit growth is to improve efficiency and operating leverage. Via its ongoing investment in the latest technology and infrastructure, the e-commerce company can ensure ongoing improvements in productivity across its supply chain.Besides, as the company's scale grows, its unit fixed costs will fall as it handles more volume with a similar asset base. These operational improvements will result in higher margins and, ultimately, profitability. For perspective, Coupang's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins have gradually improved over the years, going from negative 4.1% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2023. It has a long-term target margin of more than 10%.What it means for investors?Early investors in Coupang have suffered as the stock languished below its IPO price. Still, the ""Amazon of Korea"" has proven its viability and is well-positioned to grow its profits over time.While it's not for everyone, investors with the proper risk appetite could consider adding this growth stock to their watch lists.Should you invest $1,000 in Coupang right now?Before you buy stock in Coupang, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coupang wasn’t one of them.

-10.00%","So far, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has boosted hardware providers more than the software companies that buy their products. And with its shares up by an impressive 71% over the last year, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and its shareholders have certainly benefited from this trend. But with an uncomfortably high valuation and stiff competition from rivals like Nvidia, can AMD maintain its market-beating performance? Let's explore what the chipmaker's next five years could have in store.AMD's complicated artificial intelligence outlookSince it acquired ATI Technologies in 2006, AMD has been a direct competitor to Nvidia in the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). These advanced computer chips excel at processing multiple tasks simultaneously and were originally used for rendering video game visuals before finding additional uses in cryptocurrency mining and, finally, generative artificial intelligence training and inference. Under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, AMD has begun to put more priority on the GPU side of its business, ramping up production of its family of AI-capable MI300 Instinct chips for data center clients this year. But if you think this will quickly turn AMD into the next Nvidia, think again. Industry publication Tom's Hardware estimates that AMD's new chips sell for just one-fourth the price of Nvidia's flagship H100 despite their similar performance. And this means less growth and lower margins. To put this in perspective, AMD's fourth-quarter data center revenue increased by 38% year over year to $2.3 billion. For comparison, Nvidia's data center business soared 409% year over year to $18.4 billion in the same period. What could change in the next five years?AMD is selling its cutting-edge AI GPUs for dramatically less than Nvidia. On the surface, this suggests the company is trying to pursue a strategy of cost-effectiveness and value, which typically leads to higher sales volumes. But the reality may be a little more complicated. Story continues<img alt=""A person looks at a tablet in an office."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/E6f2lJvcWIU2VD8qbZkH_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ3MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/fa116ed1dfadeb6fc5a47224dc72a8bd"" class=""caas-img"">Image source: Getty Images.For starters, Nvidia has built a wide economic moat around its chips by creating an ecosystem of associated software such as CUDA, a programming interface designed to work with its hardware. Many companies and their developers have already built their AI infrastructure around Nvidia's hardware, leading to high switching costs and other challenges if they incorporated rival chips. On top of this, Nvidia isn't standing still. In March, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia's faster development cycle could mean that AMD will be stuck playing a game of catchup -- putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. Over the next five years, AMD should be able to slowly accumulate market share. However, it looks unlikely to replicate Nvidia's explosive growth. For AMD, AI chips are shaping up to be an important -- but probably not transformational -- part of its overall business. Is AMD stock a buy?With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 46, AMD stock is more expensive than Nvidia, which trades for just 35 times its projected 12-month earnings. This valuation is hard to justify, considering that Nvidia is growing significantly faster than AMD and has a deeper economic moat. That said, the AI chip industry looks big enough for both companies to generate significant long-term value -- especially if this burgeoning technology lives up to analysts' lofty expectations. And while AMD stock looks unlikely to outperform Nvidia over the next five years, the company could still have a place in your diversified investment portfolio.

^GSPC","Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) needs no introduction. The Warren Buffett-managed conglomerate has a stellar track record of growing value for its shareholders. It can make a great long-term investment.Here are three reasons investors should buy Berkshire Hathaway stock hand over fist right now. Similarly strong returns with less volatilityBerkshire Hathaway isn't the fastest-growing company in the world. However, it still has a knack for delivering strong returns for its investors. Here's how Buffett's company compares to the S&P 500 in recent years:TimeframeBerkshire HathawayS&P 500One year23.1%22.4%Three years47%25.5%Five years90.4%87.5%Ten years214.4%223.8%Data source: Ycharts. Data as of April 19, 2024. As that table shows, Berkshire Hathaway has roughly met or exceeded the S&P 500's total return in each of the last one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods. While the returns outside of the past three years haven't been truly market-smashing, the company has largely kept pace with the broader market's strong showing over the past decade.However, what's worth pointing out is that Berkshire has delivered similarly strong returns compared to the broader market with less volatility as measured by beta:<img alt=""BRK.B Beta (1Y) Chart"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6HBnu68evjYKjixz7X32CQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ4MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/2029cfbc081ec76ca489214df2e54821"" class=""caas-img"">BRK.B Beta (1Y) ChartBRK.B Beta (1Y) data by YChartsWith an average beta of less than 0.9, Berkshire Hathaway has been about 10% less volatile than the S&P 500 (1.0 beta). That means if the S&P 500 plunges 10%, Berkshire's stock would likely fall by less than 9%. That lower volatility can be important for investors who want to earn market returns with less risk in the form of volatility.A strong and diversified portfolio of businessesIn many ways, Berkshire Hathaway is a high-quality investment fund. The company has a large portfolio of wholly owned businesses and an investment portfolio of publicly traded stocks.The company's operating businesses are: Story continuesInsurance and reinsurance: This segment features GEICO, a collection of independently managed insurers, and reinsurance businesses like General Re.Railroad business: Burlington Northern Santa FeUtilities and energy businesses: The company owns a large diversified energy company (Berkshire Hathaway Energy) and Pilot Travel Centers.Other segments: Berkshire owns a variety of manufacturing, service, and retail businesses.In addition, the company holds an extensive portfolio of publicly traded stocks, led by:Apple: It held roughly $150 billion of the technology stock (41.2% of its investment portfolio).Bank of America: Berkshire owned over $38 billion of the bank stock (10.5%).American Express: Buffett's company owned nearly $35 billion of the credit card company's shares (9.6%).Coco-Cola: It owned almost $24 billion of the beverage stock (6.6%).Chevron: Berkshire held over $20 billion of the oil stock (5.5%).Berkshire's investment portfolio held over $364 billion in shares of publicly traded companies, with meaningful exposure to the technology, financial, and oil industries. The company focuses on owning and investing in high-quality companies in sectors it believes will grow shareholder value over the long term. It historically invests in businesses that grow their earnings at above-average rates. They use that cash flow to grow the business and return money to shareholders.A massive cash war chestBerkshire's operating companies supply it with retained earnings, while its investment portfolio provides it with dividend income. These dual sources give Berkshire a growing stream of free cash flow. That money has been piling up on its balance sheet in recent years.The company has a massive cash position, reaching a record $168 billion at the end of last year. That was up from $157 billion at the end of the third quarter and well above the $150 billion level Buffett has said is difficult to justify keeping on the balance sheet (and the roughly $35 billion analysts believe it requires to operate its insurance businesses). The company currently invests most of that money into T-bills that generate interest income. Warren Buffett and his team can use its cash position to create shareholder value. They can buy new operating companies, invest in publicly traded stocks, and repurchase Berkshire's shares when they trade at a compelling valuation. Many analysts speculate that Buffett is waiting for a meaningful market downturn so that he can find compelling opportunities to deploy his cash by acquiring strong operating businesses at a better price. In the meantime, Buffett and company are selectively deploying cash into buying stocks (the company has been adding to its oil stock position and Japanese trading houses in the past year) and repurchasing Berkshire's shares.Market returns with less risk (and compelling upside)Berkshire Hathaway has historically been a great investment. Now looks like as good a time to buy as any. Berkshire should deliver returns as good as the S&P 500, if not better, with less volatility because of its focus on owning high-quality operating companies and publicly traded stocks. Meanwhile, it offers compelling upside potential following the next downturn because that could provide Berkshire with the opportunity to put more of its massive cash position to work. These factors make Berkshire a no-brainer stock to buy right now.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dell-stock-buy-121500100.html,Is Dell Stock a Buy?,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 8:15 AM EDT",DELLSign in to add to watchlistSign in,"Shares of veteran computer maker Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) have skyrocketed over the past year. Last April, the stock reached a 52-week low of $41.47. This April, shares hit a high of $136.16.Dell's consistent ability to beat Wall Street expectations contributed to the dramatic upsurge of its stock, but another factor playing a big role here is artificial intelligence. According to Dell COO Jeff Clarke, ""We have just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, including broader adoption of AI by enterprise customers.""The company's shares dropped recently along with the broader stock market. Could this present a potential buying opportunity? To help you decide whether to purchase shares, let's take a moment to assess Dell's suitability as an investment for the long haul.Is Dell's AI-powered rise for real?While artificial intelligence (AI) may have fueled Dell stock's rise, does the advent of AI truly create a growth opportunity for the company? After all, many businesses these days are promoting AI capabilities.In Dell's case, it has the numbers to justify AI's role in driving sales for the firm. In its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Feb. 2, Dell saw orders for its AI-designed servers rise almost 40% when compared to the third quarter. As a result, the company expects to achieve sales of at least $91 billion in its 2025 fiscal year. This represents an increase from fiscal 2024's $88.4 billion.While this revenue growth is modest, it factors in the cyclical nature of the computing industry. Dell CFO Yvonne McGill explained that the current macroeconomic climate ""is leading customers to be more thoughtful about their infrastructure budgets, particularly in the first half"" of Dell's 2025 fiscal year.But looking beyond the current industry softness, AI is poised to deliver multi-year revenue growth for Dell. The global AI market is forecast to hit $184 billion in 2024 and increase to $827 billion by 2030.Story continuesHow Dell's products are poised for AI successDell's products are well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI. For example, in January semiconductor chipmaker AMD, one of Dell's partners, rolled out the industry's first desktop computer processor with an AI engine. Customers upgrading to take advantage of such devices can give Dell's revenue a boost.The PC category, in particular, is key for Dell since it generated $48.9 billion of the company's $88.4 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue. This segment's importance makes sense given that Dell spent decades making a name for itself as the go-to provider of PCs. Dell management believes its PC division will grow. Clarke stated, ""PCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC.""Dell's IT infrastructure division also benefits from the AI market's rapid expansion. Along with the company's growth in orders for its AI-based servers, Dell's data-storage products can get a boost as well. This is because AI systems require a ton of data to execute tasks, and this data must be stored for use.Other reasons to consider Dell stockIn addition to the boon that AI brings to Dell's business, another attractive aspect of the company is its ability to generate consistent free cash flow (FCF). FCF reflects the cash that Dell has available to use toward investments in its business, repurchasing shares, paying down debt, and funding its dividend.For fiscal 2024, Dell's adjusted FCF totaled $5.6 billion, up 266% over the prior year's $1.5 billion. This strong result prompted Dell to raise its dividend by 20% this year. In fact, Dell is so confident in its AI-fueled growth that it committed to raising its dividend annually by at least 10% through its 2028 fiscal year.The company's position in the growing AI market, its dividend, and solid FCF are compelling reasons to invest. Adding to this, the current consensus among Wall Street analysts is an overweight rating for Dell stock with a median share price of $130.Looking at all of these factors, Dell stock looks like a good long-term investment, especially as AI adoption ramps up over the next few years. In the meantime, investors can benefit from Dell's dividend, currently yielding a respectable 1.5%.Should you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dell Technologies wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-market-crash-experts-191734802.html,Is the housing market going to crash? What the experts are saying,"Sun, April 21, 2024, 8:00 AM EDT",,"Key takeawaysMortgage rates are high, but home prices keep rising -- blame the lack of housing supply.Economists predict that any market correction will be modest and not on the scale of the Great Recession.Experts do not expect a housing market crash, due to low inventory, strict lending standards and other factors.To the dismay of would-be homebuyers, property prices just keep rising. It seems nothing — not even some of the highest mortgage rates of the past two decades — can stop the continued climb of home prices.Prices increased once again in March, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), which reports that median existing-home prices were up 4.8 percent over last year — the ninth month in a row of year-over-year jumps. In another reflection of ongoing increases, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index for January was up 6 percent from a year earlier.So much for the now-quaint notion that the post-pandemic “housing recession” would reverse some of the outsized price gains in homes. The U.S. housing market had finally started slowing in late 2022, and home prices seemed poised for a correction. But a strange thing happened on the way to the housing market crash: Home values started rising again.— Lawrence Yun, Chief Economist, National Association of RealtorsNAR data shows that median sale prices of existing homes are near record highs. March 2024’s median of $393,500 is off the all-time-high of $413,800, but it’s the highest March median on record. (Seasonal fluctuations in home prices typically make late spring the highest-priced time of the year — the all-time-high was reached in June 2022.)Home prices have also risen more quickly than wages, a reality that intensifies affordability challenges, says Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “Any time home prices outpace people’s incomes, that is not good,” Yun told reporters recently. The result is a squeeze on first-time buyers — but repeat buyers can rely on gains from the housing market and their stock portfolios to finance purchases, Yun says.Story continuesHome values held steady even as mortgage rates soared to 8 percent in October 2023, reaching their highest levels in more than 23 years. (They have since dipped, falling briefly below 7 percent before averaging 7.33 percent in Bankrate’s weekly survey released April 17.) The main culprit is a lack of housing supply. Inventories remain frustratingly tight, with NAR’s March data showing only a 3.2-month supply.“You’re not going to see house prices decline,” says Rick Arvielo, head of mortgage firm New American Funding. “There’s just not enough inventory.”Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, agrees about the supply-and-demand imbalance. She predicts home prices will keep rising in 2024 — welcome news for sellers but not so great for first-time buyers struggling to become homeowners. “We’re not in that space where things are suddenly going to be more affordable,” Olsen says.In fact, the trend is quite the opposite. According to Realtor.com’s March 2024 Housing Market Trends Report, high mortgage rates have increased the monthly cost of financing the typical home (after a 20 percent down payment) by 2.9 percent since last year. That equates to $63 more in monthly payments than a buyer last March would have seen.Taking all this into account, housing economists and analysts agree that any market correction is likely to be modest. No one expects price drops on the scale of the declines experienced during the Great Recession.Is the housing market going to crash?No. There are still far more buyers than sellers, and that means a meaningful price decline can’t happen: “There’s just generally not enough supply,” says Mark Fleming, chief economist at title insurer First American Financial Corporation. “There are more people than housing inventory. It’s Econ 101.”Dave Liniger, the founder of real estate brokerage RE/MAX, says the sharp rise in mortgage rates has skewed the market. Many would-be buyers have been waiting for rates to drop — but if mortgage rates do decline meaningfully, it could send new buyers flooding into the market, pushing up home prices.“You’ve got an entire generation of pent-up demand,” Liniger says. “We’re in this fascinating position of tremendous demand and too little inventory. When interest rates do start to come down, it’ll be another boom-and-bust cycle.”NAR’s Yun notes that some once-hot markets, like Austin, Texas, have seen small declines in prices. But he sees little chance of falling prices on a broader scale. “Prices will remain firm and will not decline on a national level,” he said.LightbulbKey housing market statisticsAccording to Bankrate’s weekly national survey of large lenders, the average mortgage interest rate on a 30-year loan was 7.33 percent as of April 17.Existing-home sales fell 4.3 percent from February to March and were down 3.7 percent from March 2023 to March 2024 , the National Association of Realtors says.The nationwide median sale price in February was $393,500, NAR says, an increase from both the previous month and the previous year.In March, the housing market had a 3.2-month supply of housing inventory, well below the 5 to 6 months needed for a healthy, balanced market — one that favors neither buyers nor sellers.A total of 96,349 U.S. homes had foreclosure filings — default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions — in the first quarter, according to the latest numbers from ATTOM Data Solutions. That’s up 2.6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023, but down 0.4 percent from the first quarter of 2023. Delaware had the highest foreclosure rate of any state in the winter months, at one foreclosure filing for every 894 housing units.Back in 2005 to 2007, the U.S. housing market looked downright frothy before home values crashed, with disastrous consequences. When the real estate bubble burst, the global economy plunged into the deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Now that the recent housing boom has been threatened by skyrocketing mortgage rates and a potential recession — Bankrate’s most recent expert survey puts the odds at 33 percent — buyers and homeowners are asking, when will the housing market crash?However, housing economists agree that it will not crash: While prices could fall, the decline will not be as severe as the one experienced during the Great Recession. One obvious difference between now and then is that homeowners’ personal balance sheets are much stronger today than they were 15 years ago. The typical homeowner with a mortgage has stellar credit, a ton of home equity and a fixed-rate mortgage locked in at a low rate — in fact, a December analysis by Realtor.com report found that two-thirds of all current mortgages had rates below the 4 percent mark.What’s more, builders remember the Great Recession all too well, and they’ve been cautious about their pace of construction. The result is an ongoing shortage of homes for sale. “We simply don’t have enough inventory,” Yun says. “Will some markets see a price decline? Yes. [But] with the supply not being there, the repeat of a 30 percent price decline is highly, highly unlikely.”Existing home pricesEconomists have long predicted that the housing market would eventually cool as home values become a victim of their own success. After posting a year-over-year decrease in February 2023 for the first time in more than a decade, the median sale price of a single-family home has been on the rise again, with a 4.8 percent annual gain in March, according to NAR. That represents the ninth month in a row of year-over-year increases.Overall, home prices have risen far more quickly than incomes. That affordability squeeze is exacerbated by the fact that mortgage rates have more than doubled since August 2021.Experts say prices to hold strongWhile the housing market is indeed cooling, this slowdown doesn’t look like most real estate downturns. Despite prices being high, the actual volume of home sales has plunged, and inventories are still too low to meet demand. Homeowners who locked in 3 percent mortgage rates several years ago are declining to sell — and who can blame them, with current rates more than double that? — so the supply of homes for sale is even tighter. As a result, the correction will be nothing like the utter collapse of property prices during the Great Recession, when some housing markets experienced a 50 percent cratering of values.“We will not have a repeat of the 2008–2012 housing market crash,” Yun said in a statement last fall. “There are no risky subprime mortgages that could implode, nor the combination of a massive oversupply and overproduction of homes.”Ken H. Johnson, a housing economist at Florida Atlantic University, says the housing market is being pulled in two competing directions. “I think we are in for a period of relatively flat housing price performance around the country as high mortgage rates put downward pressure on prices, while significant demand from household formation and an inventory shortage place upward pressure,” he says. “These forces, for now, should balance each other out.”5 reasons there will be no housing market crashHousing economists point to five compelling reasons that no crash is imminent.Inventories are still very low: A balanced market typically has a 5- or 6-month supply of housing inventory. The National Association of Realtors says there was just a 3.2-month supply of homes for sale in March (and back in early 2022, that figure was a tiny 1.7-months). This ongoing lack of inventory explains why many buyers still have little choice but to bid up prices. And it also indicates that the supply-and-demand equation simply won’t allow a price crash in the near future.Builders didn’t build quickly enough to meet demand: Homebuilders pulled way back after the last crash, and they never fully ramped up to pre-2007 levels. Now, there’s no way for them to buy land and win regulatory approvals quickly enough to quench demand. While they are building as much as they can, a repeat of the overbuilding of 15 years ago looks unlikely. “The fundamental reason for the run-up in price is heightened demand and a lack of supply,” says Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst. “As builders bring more available homes to market, more homeowners decide to sell and prospective buyers get priced out of the market, supply and demand can come back into balance. It won’t happen overnight.”Demographic trends are creating new buyers: There’s strong demand for homes on many fronts. Many Americans who already owned homes decided during the pandemic that they needed bigger places, especially with the rise of working from home. Millennials are a huge group and in their prime buying years, and Hispanics are a growing demographic also keen on homeownership.Lending standards remain strict: In 2007, “liar loans,” in which borrowers didn’t need to document their income, were common. Lenders offered mortgages to just about anyone, regardless of credit history or down payment size. Today, lenders impose tough standards on borrowers — and those who are getting a mortgage overwhelmingly have excellent credit. The median credit score for new mortgage borrowers in the the fourth quarter of 2023 was an impressive 770, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York says. “If lending standards loosen and we go back to the wild, wild west days of 2004-2006, then that is a whole different animal,” says McBride. “If we start to see prices being bid up by the artificial buying power of loose lending standards, that’s when we worry about a crash.” Quite the opposite: A recent Federal Reserve survey of senior loan officers reveals that lending standards have actually tightened even further in anticipation of heightened demand when rates eventually drop.Foreclosure activity is muted: In the years after the housing crash, millions of foreclosures flooded the housing market, depressing prices. That’s not the case now. Most homeowners have a comfortable equity cushion in their homes. Lenders weren’t filing default notices during the height of the pandemic, pushing foreclosures to record lows in 2020. And while there has been an uptick in foreclosures since then, it’s nothing like it was.All of that adds up to a consensus: Yes, home prices are still pushing the bounds of affordability. But no, this boom shouldn’t end in bust.FAQsWhen will the housing market crash?Actually, most industry experts do not expect it to. Housing economists point to five main reasons that the market will not crash anytime soon: low inventory, lack of new-construction housing, large amounts of new buyers, strict lending standards and fewer foreclosures.Will housing prices drop in 2024?Probably not — or at least, not by much. Home prices did decrease year-over-year for a few months in early 2023, for the first time in more than a decade — but the decrease was relatively modest and prices have since risen sharply, reaching record highs. Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst, says a plateauing of prices is more likely than a steep fall, and other experts’ housing market predictions for 2024 align with that sentiment.How much house can I afford?It depends on many factors, including your credit score and how much money you earn versus how much you pay out in debts and expenses each month — known as a debt-to-income ratio. Many financial advisors recommend the 28/36 percent rule of home affordability, which states that you should spend no more than 28 percent of your gross monthly income on housing expenses, and no more than 36 percent on total debt. Bankrate’s home affordability calculator can help you crunch the numbers."
