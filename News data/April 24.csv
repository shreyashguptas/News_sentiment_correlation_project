The financial services platform and the selling shareholders sold about 15.4 million shares Wednesday for $19 each after marketing them for $18 to $21, according to terms of the deal reviewed by Bloomberg News.

Also, ION Investment Corp. had indicated an interest in purchasing as much as $50 million worth of shares at the IPO price, according to the company’s the filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Marex Group, best known for its commodities business, is one of the largest dealers on the London Metal Exchange. The company said in December it had filed confidentially to go public in New York, after pulling plans for a £115 million ($143 million) London IPO in 2021 due to insufficient demand.

The selling shareholders include Amphitryon Ltd., a firm affiliated with BXR Group and JRJ Group that is offering 8.3 million shares in the IPO, and Ocean Ring Jersey Co., an affiliate of Trilantic Capital Partners which is offering 3.2 million shares. After the offering, Amphitryon will hold 45.9% of the shares, while Ocean Ring will have 17.7% of the shares, assuming the underwriters don’t exercise their over-allotment option.

Marex Group had an after-tax profit of $141 million on revenue of $1.24 billion last year, compared with $98 million on revenue of $711 million in 2022, according to its filings.

The offering is being led by Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Jefferies Financial Group Inc. and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. The company plans to begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq under the symbol MRX.

            0.00% ","By Rae WeeSINGAPORE (Reuters) - The yen was pinned on the weaker side of 155 per dollar on Thursday as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) kicks off its two-day rate-setting meeting, leaving traders nervous as to whether Tokyo will intervene while policy deliberations are still underway.Having traded in a tight range over the past few days, a buoyant dollar finally broke above the 155 yen level for the first time since 1990 in the previous session, and was last steady at 155.34 yen in early Asia trade.Intense speculation of intervention from Japanese authorities to shore up the yen had hampered the dollar's ascent towards the psychologically key level, seen by some market participants as a line in the sand that would prompt Tokyo to take action.The breach of the 155 yen level comes as the BOJ meets to discuss monetary policy, though expectations are for the central bank to keep its short-term interest rate target unchanged following last month's landmark exit from negative rates.""We expect the BOJ meeting to deliver a marginally hawkish hold outcome,"" said Carl Ang, fixed income research analyst at MFS Investment Management.""As for policy signalling, April seems a little early to pivot away from the BOJ's March communication that accommodative financial conditions will continue for the time being.Continued expectations of gradual policy tightening and a low terminal policy rate make it difficult for the yen to appreciate significantly, even if at historically depressed levels.""BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said this week the central bank will raise interest rates again if trend inflation accelerates toward its 2% target as expected.In the broader market, the dollar was on the front foot, recouping some of its losses after a slight tumble earlier in the week following upbeat business activity data in the euro zone and the UK, which had in turn sent the euro and sterling higher.The euro was last 0.04% higher at $1.0702, but edged slightly away from an over one-week high hit on Wednesday, while sterling was off 0.01% at $1.2463.The dollar steadied at 105.79 against a basket of currencies, pulling away from a nearly two-week low hit in the previous session.Trading in Asia was thinned with Australia out for a holiday.The Aussie tacked on 0.04% to $0.6500, buoyed by receding bets of rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) this year after the country's consumer price inflation slowed less than expected in the first quarter.""Inflation is moderating but it has some way to go before the RBA can be confident it will return to the 2–3% target range on the desired timetable,"" said Justin Smirk, senior economist at Westpac.Story continues""As such, we expect the RBA to remain on hold in May and have pushed back the date of our first rate cut to November, from September previously.""The New Zealand dollar gained 0.08% to $0.5940.(Reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)View comments"

Australian financial markets are shut for a holiday. The yen traded in a narrow range after weakening beyond 155 per dollar for the first time in more than three decades on Wednesday, heightening the chances of intervention.A $250 billion exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 got hit after the close of regular US trading as the Facebook parent tumbled more than 15%. Meta projected second-quarter sales that were below analyst expectations and increased its spending estimates for the year.“Meta’s resources are vast, but not infinite,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc. “The language around spending plans has become bolder once more, and this could be what’s spooking markets.”In the run-up to the results, the S&P 500 struggled to gain traction, hovering near 5,070 as traders positioned for economic data that will help shape the views on the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Treasuries opened little changed in Asia after yields rose on Wednesday.In Japan, the yen depreciated to as low as 155.37 per dollar on Wednesday, marking the first time since June 1990 the currency had crossed the 155 level.

Gold was little changed.Earnings UnfoldingThe Facebook parent reported revenue of $36.5 billion in the first quarter, an increase of more than 27% over the same period a year ago. It was a small beat, as analysts were looking for revenue of $36.1 billion on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit more than doubled to $12.4 billion.Story continues“We encourage investors to focus on the positives,” said Tejas Dessai at Global X ETFs. “The company’s fundamentals continue to show strength, and that’s the key story.”To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, while the cohort of seven tech megacaps has done well in the last two years because of their superior earnings growth relative to the broader market, this advantage could decrease in 2024 and even more significantly in 2025.“The ‘Magnificent Seven’ are not nearly as powerful as they once were,” Hackett said. “We see this as a positive development for investors looking to diversify away from the recent market leaders.”For weeks, traders have been scaling back how many rate cuts they expect from the Fed amid a string of resilient economic data. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict gross domestic product likely cooled to around 2.5% in the first quarter, with the figures still potentially suggesting persistent inflationary pressures.“Tomorrow’s pivotal GDP report comes as market participants hope for a soft number that would lead to rate cuts sooner rather than later,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “We expect a stronger-than-projected figure.

            -3.66% ^GSPC
            +0.02% ","Humana (NYSE: HUM) stock has not been a favorite of investors this year, and the health insurer's first-quarter earnings report published Wednesday morning did nothing to change that. Following its release the company's stock traded down, to the point where it closed Hump Day down by almost 4% in price. Meanwhile, the bellwether S&P 500 index did relatively better, trading more or less sideways on the day.

Revenue and adjusted net income went in opposite directions

For the quarter, Humana's revenue according to non-GAAP (adjusted) standards totaled $29.6 billion, which was a healthy 14% higher on a year-over-year basis. Contrasting this was adjusted net income; this fell by a fairly steep 23% to just under $1.2 billion ($7.31 per share).

Both headline figures topped the consensus analyst estimates. These called for $28.5 billion in revenue and adjusted net income of $6.12 per share.

Humana, a top provider of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, said that its better-than-expected numbers were mainly due to administrative expenses that came in lower than anticipated. Yet operating in the MA space isn't necessarily advantageous these days. That's because earlier this month, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) set a payment rate increase for the program that was notably lower than many expected.

Profitability guidance disappointed the market

In its earnings release and in prepared remarks about the quarter, Humana management reaffirmed its adjusted, per-share net income guidance of roughly $16 per share for full-year 2024. That, unfortunately, is under the $16.36 collective analyst estimate. The company did not provide a forecast for annual revenue.

            -3.33% ","Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for The New York Times; Chelsea Jia Feng/BINvidia has been a cash cow for investors lucky enough to have bought in before the AI-fueled rally.Shares of the company have gained 1,500% since 2019 as its GPUs power the AI revolution.Early retail investors told Business Insider their gains had paid for cars, vacations, and dream homes.The dizzying rise of Nvidia stock in recent years has produced extraordinary gains for many retail investors, especially those who got in before the chipmaker became an artificial-intelligence superpower.The stock's steep climb — up over 1,500% since 2019 — has transformed the lives of some of Nvidia's long-term retail investors, resulting in comfier retirements, new cars, and gains worth millions for some.Business Insider reviewed brokerage and account statements to verify the gains and account balances of the investors it spoke with, some of whom asked to be identified by their first names only to protect their privacy.Tom, a 48-year-old retail investor in New Jersey, first bought Nvidia in 2011, when the stock was valued at just about $5 a share. He put in $12,000 at the time and then another $50,000 in 2022. His total stake is now worth $3 million.His fortune, which remains mostly invested and untouched, was a matter of research and good timing, he said.""They were the original creators of the GPUs,"" he said. ""I'm not even much of a techie. I'm not a computer person at all, but I knew that the GPUs would be worth something one day.""Nvidia went from a gaming icon to an AI superpower seemingly overnight. In the early days of the pandemic, its stock climbed as gamers, with time on their hands under COVID-19 lockdowns, scrambled to upgrade their computer rigs with the latest Nvidia GPUs.Then, in November 2022, the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT fueled a run of stunning growth for Nvidia as its GPUs were the only game in town when it came to powering such AI programs. The stock has essentially gone parabolic since.According to Vanda Research, Nvidia has become the top stock among retail investors, surpassing retail portfolio concentrations of Apple, Tesla, and SPY, the most popular S&P 500 exchange-traded fund.Tom said his Nvidia stake was worth about three times what he had in his 401(k) and that he felt more comfortable that he'd be able to live well in retirement, a concern that loomed over him before he went in on Nvidia.Generational wealthKiana Danial is the 40-year-old founder of Invest Diva, a company that helps women take control of their financial future and create generational wealth.Story continuesDanial hadn't heard of Nvidia before 2015, when she married her husband, who was a gamer in his free time. Danial said she liked to invest in products she uses, but when she heard her husband talk about how much he loved Nvidia, she decided to buy the stock.She first bought Nvidia in June 2016. She purchased 10 shares and shortly after continued setting new buy orders every month.""The investments started growing pretty rapidly,"" Danial said.Nvidia shares tumbled by more than 30% in 2018. During that time, Danial continued adding to her positions and started adding Nvidia to her Roth IRA and a Roth IRA she set up for her daughter.Danial sold the bulk of her shares in February and March 2023 to help partially cover a large down payment on a second home.<img alt=""Pool at Kiana Danial&#39;s house"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2awe1jm8FwQTN6Vi33OSCQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTM5OTtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/7f0971073b11b7f104fcbaeb11019830 class=caas-img>The pool in Kiana Danial's home. Her Nvidia investments helped fund a down payment.Jeff Roberts PhotographyDanial sold 800 shares over a six-week period for about $188,795, bringing her total number of shares down to 323.""I'm obviously kicking myself,"" Danial said about selling the stock. ""But we bought our dream house and it's beautiful.""The stock she still owns has left her with $202,940 in gains. She doesn't plan on selling her shares anytime soon and intends to buy more.Danial's daughter recently turned 6, and the account Danial set up for her has grown 568% and is worth around $11,000.The investors Business Insider spoke with piled into Nvidia early on because of its renown among PC gamers, but today, the company's chips are the lynchpin of the AI revolution — and there is virtually zero competition.The company's dominance has made it hard to find anyone willing to give the bear case, though some analysts have recently sounded more hesitant about further gains after the stock's meteoric rally.New financial security Rick, a 36-year-old retail investor in Texas, started buying Nvidia in 2009. The stock caught his eye because, at the time, the company seemed like the future of gaming. He invested $600, which he described as a wild-card bet.""And so $600 turned into $140K,"" Rick said.With Nvidia, Rick said he felt he had a safety net to fall back on. He's spent only a small portion of his gains so far: $15,000 to flip a car he worked on, a hobby he said he wouldn't have gotten into without the Nvidia money. For his 10th anniversary, he and his wife packed their bags for a $14,000 getaway in Costa Rica.""I had zero stress about it. It was like, 'We can spend as much as we want on this trip,'"" he said.That sense of security that such a windfall provides was the top theme among the Nvidia investors BI connected with.It's a similar story for Chris Downs, a 66-year-old who lives in rural Missouri and retired from his job as a math teacher three years ago.He's been investing for a while, but his interest in Nvidia began when he bought a new computer for video editing at the start of the COVID-19 quarantines. Downs said he splurged on an Nvidia graphics card for his setup and was impressed.He bought 112 shares in March 2020 for $79 each.In July 2023, he sold 28 shares of Nvidia at $436 apiece to offset losses from other investments. Now he has 84 shares left, worth over $65,000 based on Monday's prices, in addition to other stocks.He said he would probably sell some of his Nvidia shares closer to the election, but he's planning to invest the proceeds for his four children, as his parents and grandparents had done for their kids.Downs said his lifestyle wasn't lavish but that he tried to travel every month. Places he's been to include Bolivia, Paris, and Mexico City, and he plans to go to Spain at the end of April.He said security was the biggest perk of his investment, as well as knowing that he could cover unpredictable financial mishaps.""It's nice in retirement not to have to worry,"" Downs said.Read the original article on Business InsiderView comments"

            +0.02% ","Stocks exploded higher in the first quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 10%.What’s behind that climb? At the beginning of the year, investors were euphoric about the potential for interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Many expected six such reductions this year.But sticky inflation (3.5% in March) and strong economic growth (3.4% in the fourth quarter) dashed those hopes. Now many investors expect just two rate cuts this year.So stock bulls now are pointing to corporate earnings as a booster for stocks, saying net income is headed higher.As of April 19 a blend of profit numbers for the S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings and analyst expectations for those that haven’t showed a 0.5% increase in net income for the quarter, according to FactSet.Investor mania over the growth of artificial intelligence also has boosted stocks this year.

His S&P 500 prediction is the highest among Wall Street forecasters, he said.Now, stocks hit a wall at the end of March, and the S&P 500 has slid 3.7% this month. What has caused the decline is unclear, but TheStreet Pro’s Doug Kass has a few ideas.Kass is a hedge-fund manager whose career spans the 1970s and includes a stint as research director at star investor Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors. He now runs the hedge fund firm Seabreeze Partners.Kass correctly warned recently of mounting risks that could cause stocks to slide.Related: Veteran fund manager delivers blunt warning on stocksHedge-fund manager Doug Kass’s take on stocksOn April 22, Kass reiterated some of the market’s problems on TheStreet.com Pro:Rising geopolitical risks, such as the Mideast conflict and war in Ukraine.Higher interest rates for longer. The Fed predicts that will be its strategy in the months ahead.Prickly inflation and slowing economic growth — ""slugflation.""Reckless fiscal policy that has led to an ever-larger budget deficit and cumulative U.S. debt load.Heady valuations. The forward price-earnings multiple for the S&P 500 stood at 19.9 on April 19. That’s above the five-year average of 19.1 and the 10-year average of 17.8, according to FactSet.Story continues“As demonstrated by the weakening performance of equities during the month of April, risk happens fast,” Kass said.Kass quotes the Evel Knievel philosophyHe quoted the storied daredevil motorcycle jumper Evel Knievel's belief in the two-sided coin of risk. ""Risk is good. Not properly managing your risk is a dangerous leap,"" the deceased Knievel said.So how do stocks lie now?Related: Analyst overhauls S&P 500 target ahead of earnings season“Given the recent fall from grace, stocks have become less overvalued but still remain relatively expensive,” Kass said. “That’s especially true against interest rates and when compared to the paper-thin equity-risk premium.”The five-year Treasury security yields 4.67%, more than triple the S&P 500’s 1.4% dividend yield. The equity risk premium is the estimated return on stocks minus the estimated expected return on Treasury bonds.Fund manager buys and sells:Cathie Wood buys $22 million of battered tech stockFund manager of $100 million long/short mutual fund explains pair trade strategyGoldman Sachs revamps conviction list after stocks soar in Q1As for Kass’s current outlook, it may surprise you, given his comments.He thinks the pullback has created some opportunities, but you must be selective.“Although I anticipate a continued market correction, a few individual equities are beginning to become attractive,” he said.“In the market decline over the last few days, I have moved from modestly net short to modestly net long. I anticipate getting longer if more values emerge.” (Going short means betting that the stock will drop in price.)Kass says he plans to buy more ""if more values emerge,"" but don't expect him to buy just anything.

Riley Wealth Management's chief investment strategist moved his clients out of stocks and into bonds in 2000, and from stocks to cash, bonds, and gold in 2007, he recalled in his April market commentary.Dietrich's clients missed out on massive run-ups in stocks over the next year or so. But they also escaped staggering blows from the ensuing collapses of the dot-com and housing bubbles.They wound up netting 7% before fees during the 2000-2002 recession, when the S&P crashed by 49% and the Nasdaq plunged by 78%. They lost about 6% gross of fees during the 2008-2009 recession, but that performance trounced the S&P's 57% decline during the same period.""Despite the fun and excitement of participation in the current Mardi Gras-like stock market bubble completely untethered to any stock fundamentals, suppose an investor could miss most of a 49% or 57% decline in the S&P 500 index and then get back into the stock market when the leading economic indicators and long-term moving averages indicate the recession is over,"" Dietrich said.He emphasized that the ""wildly overvalued"" S&P would have to drop by 8% to return to its 200-day moving average, and the index has retreated by an average of 36% in past recessions.Thus, Dietrich said the benchmark could suffer a 44% rout to about 2,800 points — a level it last touched at the height of the pandemic in 2020.Dietrich also laid out why he still expects a mild recession this year. He pointed to heady stock valuations, charts flashing red, a historic jump in the so-called Buffett Indicator, the risk that interest rates stay higher for longer, and gold prices hitting record highs as signs that the market and economy are headed for trouble.The Wall Street veteran added that the recession has been delayed by vast amounts of government spending, consumers racking up debt to make purchases, and a historically tight labor market that's showing signs of cracking.Dietrich's latest warnings warrant skepticism, as the stock market and economy have defied his and other doomsayers' bleak forecasts for years now.Moreover, famed investors like Warren Buffett have warned against trying to time the market as it's virtually impossible, and steadily investing or ""dollar-cost averaging"" into an index fund is a far superior strategy.Story continuesYet several of Wall Street's biggest players, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, and Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, have all cautioned that markets aren't pricing in the risks posed by threats like inflation, recession, and geopolitical strife.Read the original article on Business InsiderView comments (20)"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sibanye-stillwater-stock-nyse-sbsw-222018043.html,Sibanye Stillwater Stock (NYSE:SBSW): Two-Pronged Approach to Precious Metals,"Wed, Apr 24, 2024, 5:20 PM CDT",,"Due to geopolitical and economic concerns, the “fear trade” is on, which bolsters the bull case for Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) stock. Based in South Africa, the company produces gold and platinum group metals (PGMs), which is significant. However, it’s also fair to point out that SBSW stock is a wildly risky idea. SBSW has fallen by 10.6% year-to-date and 44% in the past 52 weeks. While the gold market struggled previously due to rising interest rates, few sector-related stocks have been as volatile as SBSW. Still, the mining specialist wields a two-pronged weapon (gold and PGMs) that could make it enticing.Therefore, I am bullish on SBSW stock.<img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4lvVCJVEt1Ium_BOZfAuDw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0NztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tipranks_452/d8d59042130529f933a34054b194f4c9 class=caas-img>Inflation Concerns Present the Obvious Case for SBSW StockWith commodities being priced in U.S. dollars, it’s no shock to see the price of spot gold shoot higher. Historically, the yellow metal has played the role of the safe-haven asset. Given the numerous uncertainties facing global security, the fear trade has increased the demand for precious metals. Just as significantly, sticky inflation has translated to higher prices, which benefit SBSW stock.What’s more, it’s not entirely clear that the Federal Reserve can adequately tackle the scourge of rising consumer prices. Earlier, inflation data pointed to an encouraging disinflationary trend. Therefore, heading into 2024, many discussions materialized about the central bank lowering benchmark interest rates.However, a few factors may contribute to a narrative shift. First, the jobs market continues to post stronger-than-expected numbers. While economies strive for low unemployment rates, it also means that more money is chasing after fewer goods. That’s an inflationary dynamic, which supports the bullish argument for SBSW stock.Second, energy prices have soared recently. Further, the geopolitical flashpoints in the Middle East and in Europe potentially threaten global oil supply chains. If these pathways encounter disruption, that could easily spike the cost of crude oil. Simultaneously, the concerns associated with oil disruptions could exacerbate the fear trade. Again, it’s another argument favoring SBSW stock.There’s also domestic politics to consider. While the Fed acts independently of the executive branch, it’s not in the best interests of the nation to implement jarring monetary policies. That’s especially the case when the U.S. is facing unprecedented pressures, both at home and abroad.In other words, the inflationary condition may stay elevated for a while, extending the catalyst for SBSW stock. However, Sibanye also has another catalyst up its sleeve that has little to do directly with inflation.Story continuesHybrid Bonanza Should Help Lift Sibanye StillwaterAs mentioned at the top, Sibanye Stillwater mines PGMs, and I stated that it was important. One of the most critical PGMs is palladium. It plays a prominent role in the manufacturing of catalytic converters, which mitigate the environmental impact of internal combustion engines.In recent years, palladium demand faced an uncomfortable conundrum. With EV sales booming under the prospect of the platform becoming the standard of powered mobility, combustion-based vehicles could gradually be phased out. In such a scenario, there would be limited demand for catalytic converters, thus cratering the need for palladium.However, EV sales growth has slowed, causing automakers to scale back or delay their transition plans. What’s more, sales of hybrid vehicles – essentially gasoline-powered cars that boost their efficiency through an integrated battery system – have been flying out of dealership doors. Downwind, that’s a massive positive for SBSW stock.As J.D. Power pointed out, hybrids not only utilize catalytic converters, but their iterations require a higher emissions standard compared to non-hybrid combustion-powered vehicles. “This is due to hybrid catalytic converters operating at a lower temperature since the combustion engine does not operate full-time. To mitigate the natural temperature difference, hybrid catalytic converters use precious metals including platinum, palladium, and rhodium,” states the consumer research firm.According to Sibanye Stillwater’s corporate profile, the company mines all three of the aforementioned metals. So, should hybrid vehicle sales dominate—and all indications point that they will—SBSW stock is surprisingly well positioned.Granted, when it comes to precious metals, the focus right now is on gold. The beauty of SBSW stock is that the underlying enterprise gives you the gold play along with the critical PGMs. From an economic and industrial standpoint, palladium may be the most important precious metal due to the hybrid bonanza.SBSW’s Valuation Under the SpotlightCurrently, SBSW stock trades at 5x trailing-year earnings and 0.5x trailing-year revenue. Compared to the broader gold sector, Sibanye is undervalued. On average, gold miners feature a trailing-year earnings multiple of 37.24x and a revenue multiple of 2.6x.However, the challenge in describing SBSW stock as a truly objective discounted opportunity is the forward projection. Previously, Sibanye suffered from company-specific headwinds such as labor strikes. Still, with the negativity being priced in and with the newfound relevance of PGMs, Sibanye offers arguably a unique opportunity.Again, it’s not just a gold miner but also a producer of industrially pertinent assets. As such, SBSW stock deserves a higher multiple. Therefore, it’s an upside opportunity that relatively few investors are paying attention to.Is SBSW Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?Turning to Wall Street, SBSW stock has a Hold consensus rating based on no Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average SBSW price target is $5.33, implying 9.8% upside potential.<img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ocR8s7qPBsg_q1EqgFXaNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTMyMztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tipranks_452/44bc8f84adc95bb1cf253da950387691 class=caas-img>The Takeaway: SBSW Stock Is Double the FunAs with other gold miners, Sibanye Stillwater benefits from stubborn inflation and the fear trade. However, even if those elements didn’t exist, the company also specializes in PGMs. And PGMs are extremely critical for the production of catalytic converters, a product that should see booming demand thanks to rising hybrid vehicles. Thus, SBSW stock deserves a valuation rethink to the upside.DisclosureView comments"

            +0.02% ","Before market open on Wednesday, Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) unveiled its first earnings report of 2024. Happily, the company was far more profitable than many expected it to be, and investors rewarded this performance by trading the stock up by almost 5%. That compared quite favorably to the essentially flat performance of the S&P 500 index.A convincing first-quarter earnings beatIn its first quarter, Biogen took in $2.29 billion in revenue, which was down by 7% on a year-over-year basis. Its product sales slipped by 3%, led by a 4% decline in its No. 1 product category: multiple sclerosis. Other revenue saw a far steeper fall of 39%, but this segment is notably smaller (it totaled $579 million).The story was quite different on the bottom line. The biotech grew its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted net income by 8% to $535 million, or $3.67 per share.On average, analysts tracking Biogen stock were modeling $2.31 billion on the top line, resulting in a narrow miss, yet only $3.43 for adjusted, per-share net income.Leqembi was a standoutMany investor eyes were on Biogen's Leqembi, the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Leqembi performed well, as its sales were roughly $19 million for the quarter, nearly double the $10 million it earned last year (it won that approval in July 2023). The former figure was also well above the average analyst estimate of $11 million.The company reaffirmed its guidance for the entirety of 2024. It believes it will post an adjusted net profit of $15 to $16 per share, which at the midpoint would be 5% higher than the 2023 number. The consensus analyst estimate is $15.49. Revenue should decline at a low-to-mid-single digit percentage rate; Biogen did not get more specific.Should you invest $1,000 in Biogen right now?Before you buy stock in Biogen, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Biogen wasn’t one of them.

            +12.06% ","(Bloomberg) -- Big tech sold off in late hours after Meta Platforms Inc.’s disappointing outlook raised concern on whether the industry that has powered the bull market in equities has run too far.Most Read from BloombergBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll ShowsTaylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is BrokenZuckerberg Asks for Patience After Meta’s AI Push Irks InvestorsTech Giants Hit in Late Hours After Meta’s Outlook: Markets WrapBiden’s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House LawnA $250 billion exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (ticker: QQQ) got hit after the close of regular trading as the Facebook parent tumbled more than 15%. Meta projected second-quarter sales that were below analyst expectations and increased its spending estimates for the year.Meta Sinks on Revenue Guide and Spending Plans: Street Wrap“Meta’s resources are vast, but not infinite,” said Sophie Lund-Yates at Hargreaves Lansdown. “The language around spending plans has become bolder once more, and this could be what’s spooking markets.”In the run-up to the results, the broader market struggled to gain traction as traders positioned for economic data that will help shape the views on the Federal Reserve’s next steps. The S&P 500 hovered near 5,070. Tesla Inc. surged 12% after Elon Musk vowed to launch less-expensive vehicles. Nvidia Corp. tumbled over 3%.Treasury 10-year yields rose four basis points to 4.64%. The yen weakened beyond 155 per dollar, fueling intervention jitters.The Facebook parent reported revenue of $36.5 billion in the first quarter, an increase of more than 27% over the same period a year ago. It was a small beat, as analysts were looking for revenue of $36.1 billion on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit more than doubled to $12.4 billion.“We encourage investors to focus on the positives,” said Tejas Dessai at Global X ETFs. “The company’s fundamentals continue to show strength, and that’s the key story.”To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, while the cohort of seven tech megacaps has done well in the last two years because of their superior earnings growth relative to the broader market, this advantage could decrease in 2024 and even more significantly in 2025.“The ‘Magnificent Seven’ are not nearly as powerful as they once were,” said Hackett. “We see this as a positive development for investors looking to diversify away from the recent market leaders.”Interest rates staying elevated longer, along with economic uncertainty and geopolitical turmoil have lessened the appeal of some of the stock market’s cheapest strategies.Story continuesInvestors this month have pulled some $200 million out of value based exchange-traded funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. In contrast, growth stocks have attracted more than $3 billion in inflows — despite a shaky stock market that’s raised concerns of more downside to come. That diminished interest in cheap stocks comes on the heels of lackluster performances of common value products.Meantime, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. indicator is flashing a resounding buy signal in US stocks, after it hit a threshold that typically precedes better-than-average gains.The bank’s US Tactical Positioning Monitor hit a level that reflects an “attractive set-up” for the S&P 500, according to a team led by Andrew Tyler, JPMorgan’s head of US market intelligence.The stock gauge has historically gained around 3% in the subsequent 20 days after a similar four-week change in positioning, compared to a roughly 1% gain in all periods, according to the note.Investors absorbed a $70 billion sale of five-year Treasuries on Wednesday at a slightly higher-than-anticipated yield, following an even-stronger show of demand for the auction of two-year notes on Tuesday.Another $44 billion of issuance is due on Thursday, with the sale of of seven-year notes. While appetite has been resilient, investors may be less receptive to buying longer-dated securities just days before the Treasury unveils its quarterly refunding announcement and the Fed meets.For weeks, traders have been scaling back how many rate cuts they expect from the Fed amid a string of resilient economic data. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict gross domestic product likely cooled to around 2.5% in the first quarter, with the figures still potentially suggesting persistent inflationary pressures.“Tomorrow’s pivotal GDP report comes as market participants hope for a soft number that would lead to rate cuts sooner rather than later,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “We expect a stronger-than-projected figure.

            -1.64% ","Many analysts follow Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock. As expected, their price targets can vary considerably. According to data compiled by MarketWatch, the current spread is $160 to $235 per share.Recently, a pundit tracking the stock moved rather close to that upper limit by raising his fair value estimation. Let's pick it apart a little to see if it's too optimistic, just right, or even a lowball prediction.An Amazon optimist among optimistsIn mid-April, MoffettNathanson's Michael Morton lifted his Amazon price target to $230. Well, maybe ""lifted"" is overstating the case; ""bumped"" would be more like it, as his previous level was $228. In making the change, Morton maintained his buy recommendation on the dominant online retailer. That price target implies a 30% upside for the stock over the next 12 months.Morton's latest research note on Amazon came barely one week away from the company's scheduled first-quarter earnings release. He's particularly confident that the company will make a good showing with advertising revenue, which he anticipates will grow at double-digit percentage rates thanks to ads on its foundational site and what it terms ""non-core"" spots.Other reasons for his gradually increasing bullishness include effective cost management, which should result in notably higher margins, and the company's ever-strengthening regional distribution network.A multi-headed beastYes, Amazon is an easy stock to like, as it's been a relatively consistent winner over the years with a stock price that always seems to be climbing.I'm bullish on it too, and Morton's latest analysis illustrates a major reason why -- with its fingers in a great many pies, Amazon has an increasing number of revenue/profitability sources. These include the world-beating Amazon Web Services, the company's increasingly sticky Prime Video streaming platform, and, of course, those unavoidable retail services. I think this stock is one of the surer bets, especially over the long term, and it's very much a buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

            +0.02% ","Shares of PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) were on the rebound today, just one day after the stock fell 3% following its first-quarter earnings report.While the food and beverage company beat headline revenue and profit estimates, the first-quarter results were marred by a product recall at its Quaker Foods segment, and revenue fell in North America.But today the stock more than made up for those losses after a bullish note from Morgan Stanley. As a result, the stock was up 3.9% as of 2:42 p.m. ET on Wednesday.<img alt=""A person holding a chicken wing with a soda in the background."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2EyZ83X6F7YCcf4wNl0gHw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/93cd306a263445cd274617b33b9df0e0 class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.Morgan Stanley thinks PepsiCo is well pricedWhile PepsiCo still trades at a premium to the S&P 500, Morgan Stanley called the valuation compressed following the first-quarter results and said it expects a rebound later in the year due to improving trends, strength in international markets, more favorable year-over-year comparisons, and improvements in cost pressures.The investment bank strongly reiterated its overweight rating on PepsiCo and called it a top pick, with a price target of $190, representing upside of 11% from yesterday's closing price.Indeed, the company expects its performance to improve later this year, forecasting organic revenue growth of at least 4% and growth in core constant-currency earnings per share of at least 8%.Is PepsiCo a buy?Considering its price-to-earnings ratio of 26.8, the stock looks fairly valued for a company with a reputation for reliable growth in a recession-proof industry.PepsiCo is known for its dependable dividend and steady dividend growth, and its yield is now 3%. That means the stock is sensitive to interest rates as dividend stocks compete with bond yields for investor funding. If interest rates fall, then it could get a boost.For long-term investors looking for dividend income, PepsiCo looks like a fine stock, but I wouldn't expect any dramatic growth at its current valuation.Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PepsiCo wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-drives-both-ev-production-210000777.html,China drives both EV production and sales—but the fate of the country’s EV brands could soon be in the hands of emerging markets like Thailand,"Wed, Apr 24, 2024, 4:00 PM CDT",,"China is the center of the global EV market. More than half of all EVs sold last year were produced by Chinese companies, according to a recent report from the International Energy Agency. Sixty percent of all EV sales in 2023 were in China.

Yet China’s EV success could be running out of room to grow. Automakers in China are already engaging in price wars to boost sales—and a protectionist backlash in Europe and the U.S. (as well as consumer preference for hybrids) could close off those markets to Chinese cars.

That may put the fate of China’s EV brands partly in the hands of economies in Southeast Asia and Latin America, according to the IEA’s recent report. While sales in developing economies still lag China, Europe, and the U.S., growth is accelerating in economies like Thailand and Vietnam.

Thailand in particular could be an opportunity for Chinese carmakers. The Thai government has introduced a series of incentives such as subsidies and lower import taxes in a bid to boost EV adoption, and that has already attracted Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Great Wall Motor to set up facilities in the country.

Chinese-owned EV brands, which tend to sell cheaper models than their non-Chinese counterparts, doubled their market share in Thailand last year. Collectively, they have 11% of the Thai market, according to figures released by Toyota’s Thai subsidiary in February.

In a Bloomberg interview earlier this year, the president of the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand forecast that EVs will account for 20% of all vehicle registration in Thailand this year.

Indonesia is also trying to boost EV adoption, though its EV market is still small. Only 2% of its auto sales last year were EVs, according to the IEA. Outgoing president Joko Widodo previously set a target for EVs to make up 20% of all Indonesian car sales by 2025. Chinese brands like BYD and Chery, as well as Vietnam’s VinFast, currently sell in the country.

Despite concerns from automakers about slowing EV sales, the IEA is upbeat on the EV market’s prospects for 2024. The international agency predicts that EV sales could hit 17 million units this year, or over one in five of all cars sold.

With its enticing tagline “Shop like a billionaire,” Temu has captured 17% of the U.S. market share, posing a challenge to traditional American retailers such as Amazon.com Inc., Dollar Tree Inc. and Five Below Inc. The rise highlights the lucrative and disruptive nature of startups.  Owned and operated by PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), Temu offers a wide range of products, including home decor, pet supplies, beauty and health products and clothing. The platform is known for its competitive pricing, often offering significant discounts on items compared to prices on Amazon. Coupled with Temu’s discount codes, consumers can enjoy even greater savings.Don't Miss:Join the elite. Invest in Epic Games and own a piece of the $17 billion Fortnite empire.This ‘Future of Gaming’ startup disrupting a $272 billion industry is now letting anyone invest for a limited time.Temu has even become the No. 1 Shopping App on Apple’s App Store, surpassing Amazon, Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., which currently hold the third, fourth and eighth spots, respectively. The No. 2 shopping app is Shein, another Chinese retailer.Orders purchased on Temu are shipped from China and are estimated to be delivered within 10 days. However, in a bid to compete with Amazon’s fast delivery, Temu opened its marketplace to U.S. warehouses last month.

According to data analytics firm Earnest Analytics, this compares to 8% for Five Below, 43% for Dollar General and 28% for Dollar Tree.In January, Amazon announced it would lay off 5% of its Buy with Prime workforce, which equips retailers with fulfillment and delivery services.""Following a recent review, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles on our Buy with Prime team.

Consensus projects the economy grew at a 2.5% annualized pace during the first three months of the year.And risks once again appear to be on the upside, with the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tool projecting 2.7% annualized growth for the US economy in the first quarter and the economics team at Goldman Sachs calling for 3%.As seen in the graph below, these projections are a far cry from where economists saw the economy headed to start the year. The upgrades to economic forecasts have been a key talking point from the various equity strategy teams that have boosted their year-end targets for the S&P 500 (^GSPC).""The US equity market is really taking its cues from the rapidly improving perceptions of the US economy,"" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a research note on Sunday night.And given this move, what Thursday's reading from the Bureau of Economic Analysis says about the prior quarter, and how economists extrapolate that into growth projections for the rest of the year, could be key to whether the broadening out of the equity rally continues in 2024.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17439387/embed?auto=1></iframe>Today at 12:53 PM CDT Josh SchaferStocks turn positive in afternoon tradeThe three major indexes bounced back into the green in afternoon trade.The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up about 0.3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just above the flatline.Consumer Discretionary (XLY), led by Tesla's (TSLA) more than 10% surge, was still the leading sector in the S&P 500. Meanwhile, small caps lagged amid another chug higher in bond yields. The small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) was off about 0.5% on the day.Today at 12:03 PM CDT Josh SchaferTesla 'appeasing' market with product announcements helps stock survive tough earnings printTesla shares are up about 10% on Wednesday, helping the stock regain traction after a dismal first quarter.But as Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports, investors appear more focused on what the electric vehicle maker is promising could come down the line rather than the current bumpy earnings report:By the numbers, Tesla painted a dismal picture through its latest quarterly results. But the stock told a different story: excitement. New models are on the way, Musk said. And beyond that, Tesla will prosper as a pioneer in autonomous ridesharing.As Tesla car sales faltered, Musk delivered an optimistic pivot: Tesla isn't a car company.Sales fell 9% from a year ago in the most recent quarter, the first drop in four years. Operating profit tumbled more than 50% from the same period last year. Guidance, too, was a drag, as executives foresee ""notably lower volume.""But the market loved Tesla reassuring the world that, actually, cheaper cars are coming. As Jefferies analysts said in a note after the report, ""first impression for us is CEO Musk appeasing the market by accelerating new product launches.""And Musk on the earnings call emphasized over and over again that investors shouldn't view Tesla as an automaker but rather as a digital platform akin to Uber (UBER) and Airbnb (ABNB) for an autonomous fleet.During the call, when vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy dodged a question about the specific timeline for a mass-market $25,000 vehicle, Musk interjected to say that more details will come at Tesla's August 8 robotaxi unveiling. But he added his patented visionary flourish: “The way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet.”Today at 11:10 AM CDT Josh SchaferFirst quarter earnings season is looking like a ""beat and hold"" quarter, and that's not enough for investorsAs we noted in earlier this week, stocks have had a worse reaction to earnings releases this quarter than normal.And at large, strategists attribute that to the position of the market after a massive rally to start the year. Citi strategist Drew Pettit told Yahoo Finance that areas of the market, like semiconductors, already have a large amount of growth priced into their stock.""You don't just need a beat [on earnings and revenue estimates] and hold [on guidance], you need a beat and raise and confidence in the very long-term trajectory of these companies,"" Pettit said.And to this point, few companies have been able to deliver that for investors. Netflix (NFLX) and JPMorgan (JPM), whose stocks have both rallied significantly over the past year, disappointed investors by not boosting their guidance despite beating estimates.In the semiconductor space, ASML (ASML) disappointed on bookings, and TSMC (TSM) was cautious on demand for the rest of the year. Both stocks traded lower following their reports. On Tuesday night, Texas Instruments (TXN) beat Wall Street's estimates for current quarter revenue guidance, and shares popped more than 6% following the report, adding to Pettit's point that a beat and raise is the key this quarter.The large expectations have Pettit's team at Citi preaching ""patience"" on the next leg of the market rally. He, like many other strategists who recently spoke with Yahoo Finance, believes that could likely come from better performance in sectors where the comparisons to grow earnings from last year aren't as stiff.""While the growth names in the index may have a tougher time growing off of tougher comparisons from last year, the cyclicals and that part of the market needs to contribute to the earnings growth story for the index,"" Pettit said.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17667988/embed?auto=1></iframe>Today at 10:26 AM CDT Josh SchaferPresident Biden signs bill that could bank TikTok from the USPresident Biden signed a bill Wednesday morning that gives China's ByteDance up to one year to divest TikTok or face a US ban on the app.Social media stocks were little changed following the news.Yahoo Finance's Ben Weschkul reports on what could come next:The long-debated measure is fraught with political implications for the 2024 election and will also kick off a complex set of steps over the coming 12 months likely to take place both in boardrooms and in courtrooms.The bill gives the company 270 days to sell, but the president can extend the deadline up to a year. The process could end with a ban on an app that is currently used by more than 170 million monthly users in the US.""This is another front in the ongoing US-China trade war that started during the Trump administration,"" Georgetown business professor Stephen Weymouth said in an interview this week.He noted that the aggressive law will likely spur reactions from many fronts — including possible retaliation by the Chinese government. Previously, ""Congress has had a relatively hands-off approach to tech regulation overall,"" he said.The effort comes after lawmakers and the Biden administration have repeatedly charged that TikTok poses an urgent national security threat because the Chinese government could compel the company to share its data.TikTok itself has denied the Biden administration’s charges and insists it would never share US data. It has responded to this week's action on Capitol Hill by charging that the law will be ""a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans.""TikTok and ByteDance have also said that they have no intention of trying to sell, saying in a recent statement that the effect of passage will be to ""shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the US economy, annually.""But it's unclear if the company will change tack and begin actively looking for buyers now that the law is on the books.Today at 9:59 AM CDT Josh SchaferNarrow leadership in Wednesday's actionAfter a two-day rebound that saw many pockets of the market recover from the recent drawdown, Wednesday's market action has a different flavor to it.Only two sectors in the S&P 500 are higher on Wednesday morning, Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Technology (XLK).<img alt=""Source: Yahoo Finance"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1iwgdVPEHPjt0m2DzuXNOQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/28252360-024b-11ef-b6ff-77fe68f3fcd4 class=caas-img>Source: Yahoo FinanceMeanwhile, bond yields, which have been a recent headwind for stocks, are on the rise again. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose 7 basis points to 4.67%.Today at 9:14 AM CDT Josh Schafer, Pras SubramanianEarnings movers Wednesday morningTesla (TSLA) shares rose more than 14% early Wednesday after the EV maker said it would accelerate the launch of more affordable vehicles, countering reports earlier this month the company would scrap these plans.Meanwhile, Boeing (BA) shares ticked higher by about 1% after the company's first quarter results came in better than Wall Street analysts feared. Boeing reported a quarterly core (or adjusted) loss per share of $1.13, narrower than the $1.72 loss estimated, on revenue of $16.57 billion, which was above forecasts of $16.25 billion but an 8% decline from a year ago.AT&T (T) shares were on both sides of the flatline after the company reported earnings per share of $0.55, topping estimates for $0.53. The telecom company's free cash flow of $3.1 billion came in above estimates of $2.4 billion.Texas Instruments (TXN) shares rose more than 6% following the company's latest quarterly release after the close on Tuesday. The chipmaker issued revenue guidance with a midpoint of $3.8 billion, above estimates for $3.7 billion.Today at 8:35 AM CDT Josh SchaferTech leads at the openTech stocks rose on Wednesday, outstripping the broader market as investors welcomed Tesla's (TSLA) cheaper car pledge and waited for the next rush of corporate earnings.The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose roughly 0.6%, coming off a sharp closing gain. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.2%, continuing a rebound from its longest losing streak of 2024, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.1%.Today at 6:50 AM CDTBrian SozziJust off the phone: Otis CEO Judy MarksMany in the Yahoo Finance newsroom know of my joy in reading up on elevator and escalator maker Otis Worldwide (OTIS). I am fascinated by what the company makes, how it makes it, and what it all says about the health of the global economy.I just got off the phone with Otis CEO Judy Marks. Her comments to me on China — following her trip in March to the country (an important market for Otis) — left an impression:""The message from the Chinese government is: 'We want economic development. We want foreign direct investment. We're going to celebrate 40 years in China this year, and it's an important market to us.' But we've watched as the market has developed and some of the challenges in the property market, and they're really continuing. I would tell you that the property market and the new equipment market, similar to the last 18 to 24 months, it remains weak. Liquidity and credit constraints are weighing on the developers, and the top 50 developer sales this quarter were down almost 50% versus this quarter last year. So on the equipment side, we're calling this a down high single-digit to down 10% market for the year.""Marks doesn't see growth returning to Otis' China business in 2024.Today at 6:21 AM CDTBrian SozziHilton continues to buy its company backHilton (HLT) continues to be one of the most aggressive acquirers of its stock out of the gazillion companies I follow closely.In many respects, it almost feels like Hilton is taking itself private again! The hotel and resorts company went public again in 2013 after being bought by Blackstone in 2007.)This is from the company's just-released earnings report:""During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Hilton repurchased 3.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $196.17, for a total of $662 million, returning $701 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter including dividends. The number of shares outstanding as of April 19, 2024 was 250.0 million.""For perspective, Hilton ended 2022 with a share count of 277 million.Today at 6:03 AM CDTBrian SozziToymaker earnings not coming in funNo playing around here, earnings from major toymakers Mattel (MAT) and Hasbro (HAS) aren't very fun to look at.Not exactly a great earnings report from Mattel last night — which is now saying it will return to revenue growth in 2025. Mattel is unique in that the Barbie movie really drove up its results last year, so things mathematically will be down. Sales fell 1% year over year in the first quarter.Hasbro’s earnings this morning are also tough on the eyes for investors. The company is calling out a 21% sales plunge in its key consumer products business due to ""broader industry trends, exited businesses, and reduced closeout sales as a result of last year's inventory clean-up.""Both weak reports say a lot about where shoppers' minds are at right now — not with buying dolls, action figures, and board games.Today at 5:57 AM CDTBrian SozziOne stat to know on AT&TI am still wading through AT&T's (T) long earnings report, but one number caught my attention right off the jump: $4.7 billion.That's how much debt AT&T repaid in the quarter as it continues to try to bring down leverage in life after Time Warner. CEO John Stankey has told me a few times within the past year that paying down debt is one of the most important goals for his management team.As it should be — AT&T still ended the first quarter with about $132.8 billion in total debt! The company's market cap is $118 billion.Today at 5:48 AM CDTBrian SozziA list of questions Tesla investors need to ponderThe day after.Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has played investors like a fiddle. He gave them what they were clamoring for ahead of earnings — details on a cheaper Tesla — and they are eating it up. Shares are up 10% in premarket trading, and the company's ticker is dominating the Yahoo Finance Trending Ticker page.All of that is fine and good, but it all detracts (likely by Musk’s design) from the main story at Tesla that has weighed on its stock price this year: The company is struggling, and any bold promises by Musk that sends its stock higher inside an awful year for the company should be questioned big time.Here are some questions the Tesla bulls need to ask themselves:Musk promised robotaxis and showed off what its ridesharing app may look like in the earnings slide-deck. But...What do regulators have to say about this? How feasible is this launch within the next 12 months?Musk does know that Uber (UBER) exists right? And that it’s finally making nice profits and investing aggressively in its business.Musk seems to think people will want to share their Teslas and make this platform a success. What happens if they don’t want to share their tricked-out Model 3?Musk mentions Tesla will own some of the robotaxi fleet. What does that do to its cash flow and margin profile? Do investors and analysts want to see Tesla saddled with these extra costs while the pure EV business is under pressure and as they are trying to make humanoid Optimus robots?Musk promises he is fully engaged at Tesla. But...There was some interesting dialogue on the earnings call on how long Musk plans to stay CEO of Tesla. He didn’t answer precisely with a timeline and said he works on Sunday and seemingly around the clock (like many other humans). He then questioned whether Tesla could get out its robots if he wasn’t leading the company. Is now the time to ponder a Musk-less Tesla within the next few years? What does that even look like for investors? So many of his top execs have left or are leaving, including one of the guys on the earnings call last night! If buttoned-up corporate Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger is seen as failing at succession planning, then Musk could be seen as one of the worst succession planners in CEO history.Musk pounds the table on Tesla being an AI company again. But...Sure, Tesla has some amazing technology. But doesn’t Tesla make cars first that then use its technology? Who would you rather own stock in? A pure-play AI company such as Microsoft (MSFT) or a car company masquerading as an AI company?Musk hypes a cheaper Tesla. But...Tesla is no stranger to recalls and concerns about product quality. Just check out the Cybertruck recall last week! So how high quality is a $25,000 Tesla going to be? This sounds like it could be a dreadful ownership experience, not unlike when my parents bought a cheap 1986 Ford Tempo and a 1987 Ford Escort when they came out.View comments (160)"

            +13.32% ","Why Is Cullinan Therapeutics Stock Trading Higher On Wednesday?A recent academic case study, published on April 22, examined using Amgen Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMGN) Blincyto, a bispecific CD3xCD19 T-cell engager, to treat a patient with severe systemic sclerosis.The findings have implications for Cullinan Therapeutics Inc’s (NASDAQ:CGEM) CLN-978, a similar CD19xCD3 bispecific T-cell engager.Most recently, Cullinan Therapeutics, formerly Cullinan Oncology, announced its plans to expand into autoimmune diseases and intends to pursue the development of CLN-978 in autoimmune diseases, with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as a first indication.William Blair notes that the case report demonstrates that Blincyto effectively treated a patient with severe systemic sclerosis, leading to rapid B-cell depletion and symptom improvement without increasing infection risk or affecting antibody levels.This suggests the potential for using B-cell-depleting therapy in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), offering easier administration than CAR-T therapy.CLN-978’s development will initially target SLE, with Phase 1 submission planned for the third quarter.William Blair rates Cullinan shares Outperform based on the significant potential of CLN-619 for endometrial and cervical cancer, zipalertinib for exon 20 mutant lung cancer, CLN-049 for leukemia, and CLN-978 for autoimmune diseases.They believe the fair value of each share is $33.Updated data for CLN-619, expected in the second quarter of 2024, will be a key catalyst for the company, along with updates for CLN-978 in lupus and other autoimmune indications.The development of Cullinan’s other early-stage oncology assets would provide additional upside.Earlier Wednesday, Cullinan Therapeutics announced that clinical data from its Phase 1 trial of CLN-619 in patients with advanced solid tumors will be presented at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology.The data will include the first results from the dose escalation cohort of CLN-619 in combination with checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and updated results from the monotherapy dose-escalation cohort in patients with advanced solid tumors.Price Action: CGEM shares are up 15.10% at $19.18 at the last check Wednesday.Photo via PublicDomainPictures from PixabayLatest Ratings for CGEMDateFirmActionFromToJun 2021Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweightJun 2021HC Wainwright & Co.MaintainsBuyJun 2021SVB LeerinkMaintainsOutperformView More Analyst Ratings for CGEMStory continuesView the Latest Analyst Ratings""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article Why Is Cullinan Therapeutics Stock Trading Higher On Wednesday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

            +26.46% VZ
            -0.53% ","Shares of Ribbon Communications (NASDAQ: RBBN) skyrocketed on Wednesday. The single-day gains peaked at 32.7% in the early afternoon before settling down to a still-impressive 28% price increase at 2:30 p.m. ET today.The provider of hardware and software solutions for secure communication networks reported modest earnings on Tuesday evening, but also unveiled an impressive contract with Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) amid generally improving market trends.A big Verizon deal helped investors forgive weak quarterly resultsRibbon's results fell short of analyst expectations in the first quarter of 2024. Yes, that's an unusual setup for a huge stock-price jump.Your average analyst had expected the small-cap company to report break-even earnings on sales near $185 million. In reality, the adjusted bottom-line loss narrowed from $0.02 per diluted share in the year-ago period to $0.01 in the most recent quarter. Revenue fell 3.5% year over year to $180 million.So the financial results weren't impressive, but Ribbon had other tricks up its sleeve.First and foremost, it also announced a multiyear contract with Verizon. The company will help the telecom replace outdated call-routing and networking systems with Ribbon's cloud-based solutions. This network modernization should add $300 million to Ribbon's sales over the next three years -- a major boost for a company with annual revenue of less than $820 million.Furthermore, CEO Bruce McClelland outlined several signs of an improving market environment. On the earnings call, McClelland said: ""With our new Verizon program and the potential for similar engagements with other customers, we believe we've reached a low point and expect solid recovery in the business. We expect the new Verizon program alone to underpin this business for the next several years.""Ribbon's stock looks undervalued right nowThis strategic deal with Verizon could be a pivotal shift. This expanded partnership (Verizon has been a Ribbon client for years) could serve as the foundation for Ribbon's future growth, setting the stage for further industry partnerships. A $300 million network upgrade with one of the largest telecoms in America should serve as a solid selling point in other contract talks.For investors, the significant boost in projected revenue from this deal looks like a buying signal, suggesting that Ribbon's stock might be undervalued. Shares trade at 0.7 times sales and 8.8 times forward earnings projections today, and those numbers are quite low for a tech stock with robust growth potential. In other words, Ribbon could be a good buy today even after Wednesday's sudden price jump.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Ribbon Communications right now?Before you buy stock in Ribbon Communications, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ribbon Communications wasn’t one of them.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-q1-earnings-135049624.html,Meta stock plummets 15% after second quarter outlook disappoints,"Wed, Apr 24, 2024, 3:24 PM CDT","META
            -0.52% GOOG
            +0.74% ","Meta (META) reported its first quarter earnings on Wednesday, and while it beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines, a disappointing Q2 forecast sent shares of the social media giant plummeting more than 15%.Meta says it will see second quarter revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, falling short of midpoint estimates of $38.24 billion.In addition to the downbeat Q2 forecast, Meta CFO Susan Li raised the company's full-year total expenses estimate from a range between $94 billion-$99 billion to between $96 billion-$99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.On the company's earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, ""As we're scaling capex and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently. But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.""Li said Meta also continues to expect its Reality Labs division to report increased year-over-year operating losses as the company builds out its various AI, AR, and VR efforts.""While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,"" Li said in a release.Meta reported earnings per share of $4.71 in the quarter on revenue of $36.46 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $4.30 on revenue of $36.12 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Meta stock had been on a tear, climbing 131% over the last 12 months and more than 39% year to date. That’s far better than chief rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which is up 50% in the last 12 months and 13% year to date.While part of Meta’s stock performance has to do with a recovery in the digital advertising market, the company’s stock price also rocketed higher last quarter after the social media company announced it was initiating a $0.50 per share dividend and increased its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion.The company did not announce any updates to its shareholder return initiatives on Wednesday.Meta has made a series of announcements regarding its AI efforts in recent months, including debuting its Meta AI chatbot and Llama 3 large language model on April 18.The chatbot, however, has already garnered controversy after it joined a private Facebook group for mothers in Manhattan and claimed to have a child of its own, 404 Media reported.Story continuesOn the metaverse front, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Monday that Meta will make its Horizon operating system for headsets open source, allowing third-party companies like Lenovo and Microsoft to use it to build their own devices using the software. The idea is to bring more headsets to market while increasing Meta's reach in the AR/VR space.The company also stands to benefit significantly if Congress's TikTok ban, which President Biden signed into law on Wednesday, survives legal challenges. If the app is locked out of the US, it stands to reason that users and creators would turn to rival platforms like Instagram to scratch their social media itches.<img alt=""Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PffxtL2jp44Irq548PJVHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ4MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-01/7bb04d80-bed4-11ee-b7b7-f9706ecb81fc class=caas-img>Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

            +0.02% ","Boeing (BA) stock slid 2.8% on Wednesday after the company reported losses that were narrower than fear, but still reported negative free cash flow of nearly $4 billion as a result of the 737 Max crisis that has shaken the aerospace giant.Boeing reported a first quarter core, or adjusted, loss per share of $1.13, narrower than the $1.72 estimated, on revenue of $16.57 billion, which was above forecasts of $16.25 billion but an 8% decline from a year ago.The plane maker also reported negative operating cash flow of $3.36 billion, compared with a loss of $318 million last year, and negative free cash flow of $3.92 billion, compared with a loss of $787 million last year. Boeing said the results reflect lower commercial delivery volume and did not give updated production plans.""Our first quarter results reflect the immediate actions we've taken to slow down 737 production to drive improvements in quality,"" Boeing president and CEO Dave Calhoun said in a statement. ""We will take the time necessary to strengthen our quality and safety management systems and this work will position us for a stronger and more stable future.""After the release, Boeing shares initially rose in early trade, but fell midday after Moody's downgraded Boeing's unsecured debt rating to Baa3 from Baa2, citing the ""inadequate performance of Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment."" Boeing stock has lost more than 36% so far this year.Boeing's troubles begin in early in 2024, when an Alaska Airlines 737-9 MAX jet suffered a high-profile door plug blowout. It led to a grounding of its 737-9 MAX fleet, increased scrutiny of the plane maker’s 737 production and safety processes, and decreased overall plane production.It also led to a new whistleblower documenting production issues with the 787 Dreamliner and the eventual departure of CEO Dave Calhoun. Boeing stock was the second-worst performer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) during the quarter.Boeing declined to give 2024 guidance in its report.In terms of Q1 deliveries, earlier this month, Boeing reported it delivered 83 planes in total, including 67 737 jets, three 767s, and 13 787 Dreamliner wide-body jets. The total of 83 planes was a 47% drop from a year ago, when Boeing delivered 130 planes, with 113 737s and 11 787 Dreamliners as the two biggest components.Boeing’s deliveries were slowed by heightened scrutiny of its plane assembly processes at its plants in Washington and South Carolina, which led to higher costs. Impacts on Boeing deliveries and plane production could have massive repercussions on Boeing's cash flow and reserves as well.Story continues<img alt=""From Left, Boeing Quality Engineer Sam Salehpour; Ed Pierson, Executive Director of The Foundation for Aviation Safety and a Former Boeing Engineer; Joe Jacobsen, Aerospace Engineer and Technical Advisor to the Foundation for Aviation Safety and a former FAA Engineer; and Shawn Pruchnicki, Ph.D, Professional Practice Assistant Professor for Integrated Systems Engineering at The Ohio State University, are sworn in before they testify at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs - Subcommittee on Investigations hearing to examine Boeing&#39;s broken safety culture on Wednesday, April 17, 2024, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Kevin Wolf) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Last week, Boeing was the focus of two separate hearings in the Senate. One probed Boeing's safety practices and featured claims from a Boeing engineer-turned-whistleblower named Sam Salehpour about the 787 Dreamliner. Separately, another Senate panel held a hearing calling for a deeper investigation by the Justice Department to figure out whether Boeing violated the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement.In addition, airline partners like United (UAL) and Delta (DAL) have sought out new planes from other plane manufacturers like Airbus (AIR.PA), which has benefited from Boeing’s recent issues.Nevertheless, Boeing still snagged 131 gross orders in Q1, with its commercial order backlog still sitting at a whopping 5,591 planes worth approximately $448 billion. Despite all the troubles Boeing has been through, it and Airbus are still the only suppliers of wide-body commercial jets.Similarly, Boeing’s defense business is also of crucial importance to many governments, most importantly the US. In addition to fighter jets, military helicopters, and tanker jets, Boeing makes a number of drones for both air and sea use.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

            +12.06% ","Tesla (TSLA) stock gained 12% on Wednesday, its biggest one-day gain of 2024, after the company said it would accelerate the launch of more affordable vehicles, countering reports earlier this month the company would scrap these plans.""We have updated our future vehicle line-up to accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025,"" Tesla said in its first quarter shareholder release late Tuesday.On the company's earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said the timelines for new vehicles could be in early 2025 if not later this year. Tesla declined to say when the cheap EV will debut, though Musk did say the company would talk more about these vehicles on Aug. 8, the day the robotaxi will be revealed.""These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up,"" Tesla said in the release.Despite reporting a revenue and earnings miss, investors cheered the much-needed update on the EV maker's current and future prospects. Tesla stock has still lost 34% so far this year.Tesla reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.45, below the $0.52 estimated, on revenue of $21.30 billion, which missed forecasts for $22.3 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Revenue fell 9% from a year ago, Tesla's first drop in four years.Tesla reported $1.2 billion in operating profit in the first quarter and $1.5 billion in adjusted net income. Both numbers were short of forecasts and down more than 50% from a year ago. In terms of delivery guidance, Tesla said it still sees ""notably lower volume,"" echoing what the company said in its Q4 earnings report.In its shareholder letter, Tesla also showed preview images of a ridehailing feature in its app showing how a Tesla robotaxi could work.<img alt=""Tesla&#39;s preview of the ride-hailing feature coming to Tesla&#39;s App."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/b8QCifohFr5nH8ebskaYrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUwNjtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/a2244d00-01ae-11ef-bcfd-ddb05b1e5a72 class=caas-img>Tesla's preview of the ride-hailing feature coming to Tesla's App. (Tesla)Prior to Tesla's Q1 report, shares had been hit hard this year after the company reported Q4 results that disappointed, issued weak and non-specific 2024 delivery guidance, missed on Q1 deliveries, and did not refute reports of the demise of a sub-$30,000 volume EV.The revenue drop and profitability slide follow a weaker-than-expected quarter of sales for Tesla.In Q1, Tesla reported 386,810 global deliveries, well below estimates of 449,080, and produced 433,371 vehicles, also below estimates of 452,976. Tesla did note in the first quarter report that Cybertruck production hit 1000 units a week in April.Story continuesThe difference of around 46,500 vehicles produced versus sold led to concerns of demand waning globally for Tesla vehicles, which in turn has led to round after round of price cuts. On Monday, Tesla cut prices for vehicles in the US and China, leading to weakness in the stock during the day.<iframe src=https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13214098/embed?auto=1></iframe>Nonetheless, Tesla confirmed that the long-awaited next-generation platform would underpin a sub-$30,000 mainstream EV — dubbed the Model 2. That's a huge deal for investors, many of whom see the low-cost EV as a volume play for Tesla.Tesla said upcoming vehicles, including the affordable models, would use aspects of the next-gen platform as well as existing platforms, allowing them to be built on the same assembly lines as current vehicles. The ""purpose-built robotaxi,"" on the other hand, will use the revolutionary ""unboxed"" production line to be made, Tesla said.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

            +11.85% ","Shares of toy and game company Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS) popped on Wednesday after it reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024. As of 1 p.m. ET today, Hasbro stock was up almost 11%.Hasbro exercises operational disciplineIn December, Hasbro sold much of its film and TV properties to Lions Gate for $375 million, which was used to pay down debt. This divestiture is a big reason that the company's revenue was down 24% year over year to $757 million.However, even without selling this part of the business, financial results were slow. The company's key consumer products segment had a 21% drop in revenue mostly related to lower sales volume.With a divestiture, financials can be hard to compare from one year to the next, so looking at Hasbro's operating cash flow is helpful to keep things apples-to-apples. In the first quarter, operating cash flow was $178 million, up sharply from $89 million in the prior-year period.Hasbro's sales are down, but improvements to cash flow largely resulted from cutting costs. So this is likely what investors are celebrating today with the stock's 11% gain.What now?Even after today's gains, Hasbro stock is still down about 50% from its high in 2019. This poor performance reflects the fact that the business was challenged long before the first quarter. This motivated the company to lay out its Operational Excellence and Blueprint 2.0 plan in 2022.With this plan, Hasbro vowed to cut expenses and improve its operating margin to 20%, pushing annual operating income above $1 billion in 2027. The company still has work to do, but it's making progress. If management hits its ambitious goals, this stock clearly has upside. Therefore, it's important for investors to keep a finger on its pulse when it comes to its operations.Should you invest $1,000 in Hasbro right now?Before you buy stock in Hasbro, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hasbro wasn’t one of them.

            +1.88% ","Shares of AT&T (NYSE: T) were moving higher today. Investors applauded its latest quarterly results as the telecom giant easily beat expectations on the top and bottom lines.As a result, the telecom stock was up 2% as of 1:12 p.m. ET after gaining as much as 3.2% earlier in the session.AT&T is on the mendThe first-quarter results show AT&T fulfilling its promise of focusing on its core telecom business and avoiding distractions like the media mergers that have crushed the stock over the last decade, and its performance in the quarter was solid.Revenue in the quarter was $30 billion, ticking down by 0.4% as a decline in equipment and wireline revenue offset 3.3% growth in the mobility service revenue to $16 billion. However, the overall revenue number was well ahead of estimates at $28.7 billion.AT&T also reported 348,000 net new monthly paid phone customers, easily beating rival Verizon Communications, which posted a decline in subscribers in that key category. AT&T also said its postpaid phone churn was down to 0.72%, which it believed was the best in the industry.The company continued to grow its broadband business with 252,000 AT&T Fiber net adds and its consumer broadband business grew revenue 7.7% to $2.7 billion.On the bottom line, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose from $10.6 billion to $11 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell from $0.60 to $0.55, but still beat expectations at $0.50.The discrepancy between EBITDA and adjusted EPS seemed to relate to an increase in depreciation expense and a decline in other income.""Customers are choosing AT&T and staying with us,"" CEO John Stankey said. ""We achieved a record-low first-quarter postpaid phone churn, grew consumer broadband subscribers for the third consecutive quarter, and expanded margins in Mobility and Consumer Wireline.""What's next for AT&TAT&T reaffirmed its guidance for the year, calling for wireless service revenue growth of 3%, broadband revenue growth of at least 7%, and adjusted EBITDA growth of around 3%.It also continues to see adjusted EPS of $2.15 to $2.25 and expects a return to adjusted EPS growth next year.Given the beats on the top and bottom lines and the strong postpaid net phone additions, it's not surprising to see the stock moving higher on the news.Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AT&T wasn’t one of them.

In 2023, the company at times felt the impact of softening demand from customers due to economic uncertainty.Those headwinds continued into 2024. Watsco earned $2.17 per share on revenue of $1.56 billion in the quarter, falling short of Wall Street's estimates for earnings of $2.28 per share on sales of $1.59 billion. Revenue was up 1% including the impact of acquisitions, but down 2% on a same-store basis.But management sees conditions improving heading into the summer cooling season, giving investors a reason for optimism.""While softer market conditions persisted during what is essentially the low-season for product sales, we are currently experiencing growth in end-market demand as we enter the summer selling season,"" CEO Albert H. Nahmad said in a statement. ""We believe market share gains are continuing, and we are proud to have added three new companies to our family since the beginning of last year.""Is Watsco stock a buy following its earnings report?Even when end markets are weak, Watsco can generate cash, allowing the company's board to boost the stock's annual dividend by 10% earlier in the year. Watsco has no debt and had $479 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of the quarter's end.At worst, Watsco is a good income-producing stock with the wherewithal to sustain and increase the dividend for the foreseeable future.

            -0.87% ","Attention should surely be paid to any stock that has double-digit upside potential. That's very much the situation with online and mobile sports betting platform operator DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG).At least, that's the take from one analyst following the stock, who feels that its price could climb 46% over the next year or so. Here's why he thinks the company is well worth a wager.DraftKings has real upside potentialOppenheimer's Jed Kelly has been quite the DraftKing bull for some time now, and this month he reiterated his sunny stance on the company. He very much rates it a buy at a price target of $60 per share, quite some height above its present level of just above $41.Kelly felt compelled to write a new research note on the gaming company's stock, as it has slid by more than 16% from the 52-week high it reached in late March. He opined that the current softness is due to ""mostly optical"" factors, including some political rhetoric against gambling legalization (this is an election year, after all). Kelly stated that, meanwhile, ""structural fundamentals around player engagement/retention, product, and advertising efficacy remain[s] intact."" So for him, the stock is a highly attractive buy on weakness just now.No sure betThere's no denying that legalized gambling has a bright future, despite the occasional politician railing against it and the numerous competitors eager to increase market share.Is DraftKings an ideal play on that future, though? I'm not yet convinced. Yes, top-line growth indicates the company's doing a fine job capitalizing on its opportunity, but it has yet to prove it can book a net profit with any consistency. Meanwhile, there remains plenty of resistance to legalization throughout this country, so the company could continue to play at a handicap for quite some time.

            +12.79% ","Trump Media (DJT) CEO Devin Nunes is urging Republican lawmakers to investigate ""potential manipulation"" of DJT's stock in response to what he claims to be ""anomalous trading"" of shares.""Since April 2, 2024, DJT has appeared every day on Nasdaq’s 'Reg SHO threshold list,' which is indicative of unlawful trading activity,"" Nunes wrote in a letter sent to House GOP leaders on Monday. ""This is particularly troubling given that 'naked' short selling often entails sophisticated market participants profiting at the expense of retail investors.""Short interest in DJT stock — bets that the stock price will fall rather than rise — is about 13% of outstanding shares, according to the latest data from S3 Partners. The company recently attempted to fend off short sellers by advising investors on ways to prevent their shares from being loaned for short-interest positions.In order to ""short"" a stock, a trader must first borrow shares that are already owned before they can be sold. A ""naked"" short sale is an illegal practice of selling a short share that has not yet been borrowed.""Reports indicate that, as of April 3, 2024, DJT was the single most expensive stock to short in US markets by a significant margin, meaning that brokers have a significant financial incentive to lend non-existent shares,"" Nunes's letter continued.Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. in a deal approved by shareholders late last month. Shares, which climbed more than 10% on Wednesday, have fallen about 50% since the end of March.Nunes singled out four market participants that have been responsible for more than 60% of the volume of DJT shares traded: Citadel Securities, VIRTU Americas, G1 Execution Services, and Jane Street Capital.The claims echo what Nunes argued in a separate letter sent to Adena Friedman, chair and CEO of the Nasdaq, on April 18.Representatives for Citadel, VIRTU, and Jane Street did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.<img alt=""Former President Donald Trump appears at Manhattan criminal court during jury selection in New York, Monday, April 15, 2024.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investments-boost-net-worth-more-112500834.html,These investments will boost your net worth more than any growth stock,"Wed, Apr 24, 2024, 2:15 PM CDT",,"Getty Images/iStockphoto -Long-term investors who are considering buying “growth stocks,” i.e., stocks with high price-earnings (P/E) ratios, may want to think again. The phrase “growth stocks” appears to be a misnomer.Most Read from MarketWatchElon Musk gives Wall Street what it wants, but more pain could be around the corner‘I don’t want to end up with stalkers’: Should I tell my heirs that I’m writing a will and how much they can expect to inherit?‘Please don’t judge me’: I’m 54, and married with 5 kids. I have $20,000 in debt and $20,000 in mutual funds. I just inherited $10,000. How do I invest it?Here’s who really benefits from Biden’s $153 billion in student-debt cancellationThe U.S. Treasury is about to take a step designed to make the bond market more resilientIn general, differences in future earnings growth are fairly modest between high P/E and low P/E stocks and are far too small to justify the large differences in prices between those two sets of stocks. On average and over the long run, high P/E stocks deliver significantly lower returns than low P/E stocks.What do P/E ratios imply? The ratio of a firm’s price to its earnings is one of the most common metrics used to evaluate a stock. A high P/E ratio could indicate that a stock’s earnings are expected to grow rapidly in the future. For this reason, high P/E stocks are typically called “growth stocks.” Alternatively, a high P/E ratio could indicate that a stock is overpriced and will have low returns in the future.Retail investors lured by stocks with high price multiples must scrutinize the fundamentals. A safer bet is to pick value stocks with low P/E ratios that deliver long-term.In research with my co-authors, Ricardo De la O and Xiao Han, we evaluate these two possibilities. We track long-term buy-and-hold earnings growth and returns for all listed U.S. stocks from 1963 to 2020 over 15-year rolling periods. The results clearly show that differences in returns between high P/E stocks and low P/E stocks are much larger than the differences in earnings growth. In other words, high P/E ratios mainly signal low future returns rather than high future earnings growth.The growth stock misnomerFundamentally, buying a share in a company entitles you to a portion of that company’s earnings. For a buy-and-hold investor, the key question is how these future earnings compare to the price one must pay upfront to purchase a share. For example, a doubling of the price must be matched by a doubling of the future earnings, otherwise the share will deliver lower long-term returns. Similarly, a doubling of the P/E ratio must be matched by a doubling of future earnings growth if the investor wants to earn the same return.Story continuesThis raises a difficult challenge for high P/E stocks. A stock with a P/E ratio of 75 must quintuple its earnings over the next 10-15 years just to match a stock with a P/E ratio of 15 that has no growth in earnings at all. More realistically, if the stock with a P/E ratio of 15 doubles its earnings over the next 10-15 years, which is a fairly conservative rate of growth, then a stock with a P/E ratio of 75 must 10x its earnings over that same period.While there are certainly some stocks that achieve this type of enormous growth, these tend to be the exception rather than the norm among high P/E stocks. Using 15-year earnings growth for a large set of stocks, we find that earnings growth for high P/E stocks was only one-fourth the amount required to justify their high P/E ratios. Instead, three-fourths of their high P/E ratios was accounted for by low 15-year returns. In short, most high P/E stocks struggle to generate anywhere near enough future earnings to repay their high valuations.Takeaways for investorsWhen choosing stocks, investors should seriously assess P/E ratios, as well as valuation multiples more broadly. What kind of earnings growth would be needed to repay your current investment, and does this seem realistic? Do comparable firms consistently show similar growth? While short-term price movements often attract a lot of attention, it is these more fundamental questions that play a large role in determining long-term returns.Overall, our results suggest that long-term investors should tilt more towards stocks with low P/E ratios. A small adjustment would be to replace high P/E stocks with lower P/E counterparts within the same sector or industry. These lower P/E counterparts essentially have more room for price growth going forward and will require less growth in earnings to repay the initial investment. A larger adjustment would be tilting towards lower P/E sectors such as utilities or consumer staples.As always, it is important to diversify across many low P/E stocks rather than concentrating in a single stock. Some stocks may have low P/E ratios because they are distressed or near bankruptcy. However, when assessing a diversified portfolio of low P/E stocks, we find that the risk (i.e., the volatility of 15-year returns) is nearly the same as the risk of a diversified portfolio of high P/E stocks, yet carries a substantially higher average return.Read: Why you shouldn’t be too quick to dump your stocks just yetWhen growth stocks deliverOf course, some growth stocks do phenomenally well and manage to deliver high returns to their investors, in particular investors who bought shares in the company’s earlier periods in which there was more room for the price to increase. But it is very hard to find these unicorns.While we all know of tech giants that rapidly grew to dominate a specific market, don’t forget the companies that failed to live up to investors’ high expectations and the numerous high P/E companies that went out of business. For every Google (now Alphabet GOOGL), there is a Cisco Systems CSCO, a company that had a P/E ratio of 200 during the late 1990s dot-com boom and whose stock price has still yet to recover to its 2000 highs, along with many like Pets.com that completely shut down.Unless you can pick the handful of unicorns, the better long-term return strategy seems to be investing in a broad set of low P/E stocks rather than high P/E stocks.Sean Myers is an assistant professor of finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

            -0.32% ","There's no question that Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) has struggled of late. Like much of the electric vehicle (EV) industry, the stock price is down on disappointing sales results and industrywide price cuts. The price has fallen nearly 64% over the past year.However, at least one Wall Street analyst sees some upside to the luxury EV maker. Citigroup recently resumed coverage of Lucid stock with a neutral rating and a price target of $2.90, giving it a 14% upside over the next 12 months from its current level.<img alt=""The Lucid Air lineup"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/P61WRB3JGmiEAMjj3dBCWQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUwNDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/89f723db0f91859c86fc2581865d0c5e class=caas-img>Image source: Lucid.Citi is bull-ish on LucidWhile a neutral rating might not inspire much confidence from investors, the price target indicates a favorable expectation for Lucid, which is rapidly losing money, much like other EV start-ups.The bank said the risk/reward in the stock seemed to be fair and credited Lucid's strong technology position. However, it noted challenges with demand and pressure on its launch of the Gravity SUV model, expected later this year.Can Lucid bounce back?At this point, a lot seems to need to go right for Lucid to have long-term success and top the analyst's target. The company seems to be far away from its break-even point, having delivered just 6,001 vehicles in 2023, and demand seems to be weakening for its high-priced sedans, as it produced 8,428 cars last year. For 2024, it's aiming to produce 9,000 cars, which is only 6.8% growth.However, Citi is correct that Lucid's technology stands out in a crowded industry as its Air sedans have the longest range of any EV on the market. It has won several awards, including the 2023 World Luxury Car of the Year. It also licenses its technology to Aston Martin, and licensing could prove to be a more viable business model for the company. Lucid could also make for an intriguing acquisition target for a luxury carmaker.While the company does have potential, it's clear from its current financials, growth trajectory, and industry challenges that something will have to change in order for it to survive and thrive.Should you invest $1,000 in Lucid Group right now?Before you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lucid Group wasn’t one of them.

            -11.05% ^GSPC
            +0.02% ","Shares of less-than-truckload shipper Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ: ODFL) fell 10.2% through 1:15 p.m. ET today despite largely meeting market expectations for its first-quarter earnings this morning.Heading into the quarter, analysts had forecast Old Dominion would earn $1.34 per share on sales of $1.47 billion. As it turned out, earnings were $1.34, and revenue only just missed expectations at $1.46 billion. So are investors overreacting here?Old Dominion Freight Line's Q1 earnings reportNot necessarily. Expectations for Old Dominion have been running pretty hot, with most analysts agreeing the company will grow earnings at about 23% annually over the next five years. It's this expectation that the stodgy shipping stock will turn out to actually be a growth stock that explains why it has been outperforming the S&P 500 lately, lifting its stock price to nearly 40 times earnings today, up 44% over the last 52 weeks.But Old Dominion didn't grow anywhere near 23% in the first quarter. Despite mostly meeting expectations, its earnings growth was actually closer to 4%, and its sales grew barely 1%. CEO Marty Freeman called these results ""solid,"" but investors were apparently hoping for more.Is Old Dominion stock a buy?They might have to wait a while to get it. Freeman noted that the U.S. economy remains soft and, while he thinks overall demand for its services might be improving, the company still faces operating challenges that could keep growth in check.Nor did Old Dominion's report provide specific guidance for sales or earnings later this year, to suggest that the hoped-for growth is right around the corner.So what are investors left with? A stock with a price-to-earnings ratio of 40 that might grow 23% eventually, but actually did just grow earnings 4% instead.

            -3.97% ","General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) has been among the best-performing defense stocks so far this year, but the company stubbed its toe this earnings season. Shares traded down nearly 6% as of 12:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday following a bottom-line miss.Gulfstream in a holding patternGeneral Dynamics stock came into earnings season up about 13% for the year, well above the break-even performance of most defense suppliers. The company's combination of business jet and defense assets seemed poised for above-average earnings in 2024, making it a top pick among investors.But the company's Gulfstream unit didn't get its new G700 business jet certified by year's end, as hoped, and the delay took a toll on earnings.Earnings per share were $2.88 in the quarter on revenue of $10.7 billion, a mixed result compared to Wall Street's consensus estimates of $2.93 in EPS on revenue of $10.3 billion.""Our businesses delivered solid operating results in the quarter, growing revenue and backlog, while expanding margins, even as we awaited G700 certification,"" CEO Phebe N. Novakovic said in a statement. ""In the aerospace segment, the recent FAA certification of the Gulfstream G700 has enabled us to begin customer deliveries. This is a strong start to 2024, and we remain confident in our outlook.""The defense side of the business is doing well, led by combat-systems revenue growth of 20%. Overall, defense booked as much new business as it billed out in the quarter.Is General Dynamics a buy following its earnings miss?The thesis heading into 2024 was that a combination of geopolitical tensions and demand for Gulfstream's new models would push General Dynamics higher. Internal changes to the way the Federal Aviation Administration handles the certification process delayed that thesis, but it is far from sunk.General Dynamics' military business has good exposure to areas of Pentagon demand, and an aging fleet of business jets should create opportunities for the now-certified G700. The company also pays a dividend, currently yielding just over 2%, and has been steadily using repurchases to reduce its share count by nearly 20% over the past decade.Earnings didn't go to script this quarter, but the case to buy General Dynamics is just as strong today as it was before the company reported.Should you invest $1,000 in General Dynamics right now?Before you buy stock in General Dynamics, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and General Dynamics wasn’t one of them.

Top-line sales trended 16% lower at $3.66 billion. But your average Wall Street analyst expected even deeper declines across the board, setting their consensus earnings target at $1.07 per share on roughly $3.61 billion of revenue.Management's second-quarter guidance was right in line with the current Street views.After the report, a plethora of analysts raised their target prices for Texas Instruments stock. Both the bulls and the bears stuck to their overall recommendations, just with consistently higher stock price targets.The semiconductor business is returning to normalMany of TI's customers are working through overstuffed chip inventories, resulting in slower sales of new product. The bottom-line surprise largely sprung from the sale of a property, adding $0.10 per share of unexpected profits. Without that item, TI's first-quarter business developed pretty much as expected.However, earnings call comments showed some signs of normal seasonality -- a valuable upgrade from the below-average business trends TI saw over the last two years. Components for personal electronics was ""the first market that went into the correction"" in the inflation crisis, but it's also first one returning to ordinary seasonal sales patterns.That insight added more value to TI's stock than the modest earnings surprise did. Business is getting back to normal, possibly ending a long period of macroeconomic stress and abnormal order trends. Meanwhile, TI's stock trades in a Goldilocks zone of reasonable pricing.

            +0.33% ","Shares of credit card giant Visa (NYSE: V) jumped more than 3% in early trading this morning after reporting (apparently) stronger than expected fiscal Q2 2024 earnings -- and much better than expected revenue.

Heading into the quarter, analysts forecast Visa would earn $2.29 per share on $8.1 billion in revenue. In fact, Visa earned $2.51 per share on $8.8 billion in sales. Investors' enthusiasm for the news is, however, moderating as the day wears on. As of 12:20 p.m. ET, Visa stock has retraced to just a 1% gain.

Visa's Q2 earnings report

There may be some confusion about what analysts predicted Visa would earn, and what it actually did earn. Visa noted that its earnings as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) were actually $2.29 on the nose -- exactly what analysts predicted. The $2.51 per share earnings, it turns out, was only Visa's non-GAAP profit, which adjusts for what the company considers ""one-time items.""

That quibble aside, however, there's no debate that Visa trounced analyst revenue predictions. Revenue for the quarter was definitely $8.8 billion, a 10% increase year over year. And GAAP profits were up even more -- 12%.

Is Visa stock a buy?

Visa seems to think these are buyable numbers. Over the course of the quarter, it bought back $2.7 billion worth of its own stock. Unfortunately for investors, Visa paid an average of $280.80 per share for these buybacks -- more money than the stock is worth today.

Was that a mistake?

Perhaps. In its post-earnings conference call, Visa mentioned that it hopes to grow earnings again in the ""low double-digits,"" as The Fly reports. Assuming this translates to another 12% growth quarter -- or even the 13% or so long-term growth rate that Wall Street has Visa pegged for -- the stock looks expensive to me at a P/E ratio of nearly 32, and a PEG ratio of at least 2.4.

While I wouldn't call Visa stock a sell necessarily, it doesn't look like a compelling buy either.

This fireside chat recap is from FreightWaves’ Small Fleet and Owner-Operator Summit.

FIRESIDE CHAT TOPIC: An update on the transportation and logistics M&A landscape.

DETAILS: The transportation M&A market appears to have stabilized, said Spencer Tenney, president and CEO of M&A advisory firm the Tenney Group, at FreightWaves’ Small Fleet and Owner-Operator Summit.

KEY QUOTES FROM TENNEY:

On what prompted the slowdown in transportation M&A: “The freight market and then this accelerated sequencing of interest rate hikes that was unlike anything that we’ve seen in the last 40 years. So, understandably both buyers and sellers took a wait-and-see posture.”

On market stabilization: “We’re in a much more stabilized market. It’s not ideal for either party, both in terms of the cost of capital or the freight market for that matter. But when you have pain in a marketplace you don’t need ideal conditions, you just need stable conditions, and that allows both buyers and sellers to work together collaboratively.”

On what acquirers like currently: “The buyers are acquiring these companies [brokerages, dry van dedicated fleets and bulk haulers] because they either provide insulation, diversification or some contractual-type revenue, which addresses a very specific sensitivity that maybe created some pain for them in the last 18 months.”

Tesla shares jumped ahead of the opening bell Wednesday after months of declines.

The EV maker posted disappointing quarterly earnings, but talk of new models excited investors.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq futures rose 0.6% and S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.2%.

Tesla's stock rallied before the opening bell on Wednesday as investors reacted to the electric car maker's first-quarter earnings report.

Shares rose as high as 13% in premarket trading and were still up 10% shortly after 5 a.m. ET, putting the company's valuation on course to rise by about $45 billion.

The gains came after Tesla's earnings of $0.45 per share for the three months ending March 31 missed analysts' expectations.

Traders appeared to shrug off those disappointing results and instead focus on the ""Magnificent Seven"" company's promise of producing new, more affordable EVs from next year.

""We have updated our future vehicle line-up to accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025,"" Tesla said.

Tesla's announcement is a ""positive story,"" Sophie Lund-Yates, Hargreaves Lansdown's lead equity analyst, wrote in a morning research note.

""The market responded well to news it's planning to accelerate the launch of its new models,"" she added. ""This will put the brakes on planned cost cutting, but is a way to hopefully boost volumes. In the increasingly competitive space of EVs, Tesla's must-have status is one element it has above the others.""

Tesla's premarket surge will be welcome news for shareholders after the stock's dismal start to 2024. It's tumbled 42% year-to-date, dragged lower by signs of a slowdown in demand for electric vehicles.

Meanwhile, US stocks looked set to start the day in the green, with S&P 500 futures up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbing 0.6%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were trading flat at last check.

            -11.05% ","Less-than-truckload stocks sell off following Old Dominion's first-quarter report. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Old Dominion Freight Line said it is seeing promising signs around demand but that it isn’t yet ready to call a cycle upturn. However, its operating ratio guidance for the second quarter was weaker than the historical trend, which may be the reason shares of less-than-truckload carriers sold off on Wednesday.Old Dominion (NASDAQ: ODFL) reported earnings per share of $1.34 for the 2024 first quarter, which was in line with the consensus estimate and 5 cents ahead of the year-ago result when accounting for the company’s March two-for-one stock split.The in-line result wasn’t enough for investors.Shares of ODFL were down 10.9% at 12:46 p.m. EDT Wednesday compared to the S&P 500, which was down 0.5%. Other LTL competitors saw shares sag as well. ArcBest (NASDAQ: ARCB) was down 8.4%, XPO (NYSE: XPO) was down 7.3% and Saia (NASDAQ: SAIA) was off 5.9%.Old Dominion’s revenue increased 1.2% year over year (y/y) to $1.46 billion as tonnage fell 3.2% (shipments and weight per shipment were down 0.5% and 2.7%, respectively), which was offset by a 4.1% increase in revenue per hundredweight, or yield. (Yield was up 6.7% excluding fuel surcharges.) Lower shipment weights helped boost the yield calculations.Revenue per shipment (excluding fuel surcharges) was up 3.8% y/y even though weight per shipment and length of haul were detractors.The company said revenue per day is up 5.5% to 6% so far in April as tonnage per day is 2% to 2.5% higher and yield is 4% higher (up 4.5% excluding fuel surcharges). At 48,000 shipments per day, April isn’t seeing the historical sequential uptick from March when accounting for the timing of Good Friday. Over the past 10 years, Old Dominion has recorded an average sequential increase of 8.7% in revenue per day from the first to the second quarter. It’s seeing about half that growth rate currently.Management said the smaller increase in yield during April is tied to freight mix changes and that it hasn’t altered its approach to pricing. It said the increase it has seen in revenue per shipment excluding fuel so far in April (not disclosed) is close to the increase it logged in the first quarter.“It feels similar to 2017 where things are kind of on the edge of getting ready to start showing improvement again, and hopefully we’ll continue to see some growth as we go through the middle part of the year. Some year-over-year growth and further sequential improvement, and then things really start taking off,” said CFO Adam Satterfield on a Wednesday call with analysts.<img alt=""Table: Old Dominion’s key performance indicators"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WAyav9bglrTAz_z25LoDjw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ0NTtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/freightwaves_373/45e2d2389112eb893ac5cb1848f86533 class=caas-img>Table: Old Dominion’s key performance indicatorsThe company reported a 73.5% operating ratio, which was 10 basis points worse y/y and 170 bps worse than the fourth-quarter result (150 bps worse than the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis). The unadjusted result was in line with management’s guidance of 170 to 220 bps of sequential deterioration.Story continuesSalaries, wages and benefits expenses (up 60 bps as a percentage of revenue) and higher depreciation and amortization expenses (up 50 bps) were the primary headwinds in the period.The company’s first-quarter OR was its worst since the fourth quarter of 2021. However, it is carrying some growth-related costs currently. Its head count is up 3% since the third quarter even though shipments are off roughly 6%. It is also carrying 30% excess capacity throughout the network as it plans for an eventual turnaround.Old Dominion expects 150 bps in OR improvement from the first to the second quarter this year compared to the historical average of 350 to 400 bps of improvement. Softer sequential revenue trends so far in the quarter are the reason for the weaker guidance.The company reiterated a long-term goal of a sub-70% annual OR as it plans to continue to price freight 100 to 150 bps above costs. However, the spread between the increases in revenue per shipment and cost per shipment was 50 bps negative during the first quarter.Total capital expenditures guidance of $750 million for the year was reiterated. The allocation also remained unchanged with $350 million slated for real estate projects, $325 million for tractors and trailers, and $75 million for IT and other assets.“Once we have that tailwind coming at us from an overall industry demand standpoint, we’ll be able to capitalize and be able to significantly grow our volumes like we’ve been able to do in the past, and then leverage that growth through the operating ratio,” Satterfield said.More FreightWaves articles by Todd MaidenHeartland Express books another net lossForward Air taps Ceva unit head as next CEOPam Transportation books operating loss in ‘extremely challenging’ Q1The post Old Dominion’s Q1 earnings meet estimate, but LTL stocks fall anyway appeared first on FreightWaves.View comments"

Just over a year later, capital markets are open and even borrowers in still-unpopular industries — such as the office space — have access to credit.That’s a dramatically rosier picture than the backdrop a year ago, when the DoubleLine Commercial Real Estate ETF (ticker DCRE) launched into the eye of the storm. Last spring, no matter the location or underlying leases, most office loans were priced as if a three-year extension and a blanket loss of 60% severity was guaranteed, Chen said. Now, as the markets dial back expectations for the “worst possible outcome,” that means that investors need to spend more time finding mispriced opportunities.“There’s more of this ‘sharpen your pencil’ environment where investors are resetting their expectations,” Chen said in a phone interview. “The shift is the markets getting smarter or more efficient and people are more willing to roll up their sleeves and dig into this. That’s also a very healthy sign, it’s very akin to a stock pickers’ market.”Spreads on CMBS have tightened more than almost any other type of popular credit, with BBB- rated bonds shaving off nearly 260 basis points over the last year, according to data from Citigroup.Read More: LibreMax’s Lippmann Building Portfolios Resilient to High RatesThat tightening has occurred even as worries linger over commercial real estate amid a murky outlook for office properties and gnawing questions about the health of small and midsize lenders. Despite those concerns, there’s been “incredible” credit availability for CRE borrowers as of late, according to Chen. So far this year $23.5 billion of non-agency CMBS has been issued, or nearly 160% more than at the same time last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News as of Tuesday.Tightening spreads are good news for the actively managed DCRE, which commands about $130 million. Since the ETF began trading last April, it’s climbed more than 7% on a total return basis, compared to roughly 3% for the fund’s benchmark.Story continuesAs the market has moved away from the most-bearish scenarios, DCRE has broadly kept to its founding portfolio setup: short-duration securities with “high probability” outcomes in terms of payoffs, Chen said.“Inside of the two-year part of the curve is very interesting. It’s an area where if you want to play offense, you can play offense,” Chen said. “You need to find the right bonds, understand the structure, understand the dynamic in terms of the CMBS market, and that’s what we’re here to do.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ LenderBig Junk Food’s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for DinnerHow a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation’s SecretsStudio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount MergerChina’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments (1)"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mattel-stock-jumped-morning-165440036.html,Why Mattel Stock Jumped This Morning,"Wed, Apr 24, 2024, 11:54 AM CDT","MAT
            +2.40% ","Shares of toy company Mattel (NASDAQ: MAT) jumped on Wednesday morning following its financial report for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. As of noon ET, Mattel stock was up almost 5%.

Investors look past some shortcomings

The stock market's positive reaction to Mattel's financial results is a little surprising. Q1 net sales were down 1% year over year to $810 million, which was below expectations. The company's gross margin had a strong improvement to 48%. Its net loss improved by $78 million compared to the prior-year period. But despite the profit improvements, it still had a Q1 net loss of $28 million.

In short, Mattel's financial results may have had some encouraging elements, but I wouldn't necessarily call them good.

For the rest of the year, Mattel's guidance is modest. The company expects sales to be flat compared to 2023. And it expects its free cash flow to drop to $500 million compared with over $700 million last year.

Plenty of silver linings

With brands such as Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, Mattel has some of the most recognizable properties in the business. The company seeks to keep these at the forefront of consumer awareness and leverage them for other opportunities, such as last year's Barbie movie. And it's in a solid financial position with around $1.1 billion in cash.

Mattel's shareholders will be rewarded with share repurchases and dividend payments in 2024. But keep in mind that management doesn't expect top-line growth until 2025. The stock might not have much upside before that growth starts materializing.

            +36.97% ","(Bloomberg) -- B. Riley Financial Inc. sent its stock soaring by finally delivering its overdue annual report, which provided fuel both for fans of the boutique investment bank and skeptics who contend its accounting is deeply flawed.Most Read from BloombergBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll ShowsTaylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is BrokenTech Giants Hit in Late Hours After Meta’s Outlook: Markets WrapMeta Projects Higher Spending in Deeper Push Into AIBiden’s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House LawnAuditors for Los Angeles-based B. Riley cited various material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls, and some of the previously reported data was revised, according to regulatory filings.Separately, B. Riley said a new probe it commissioned by a second law firm found the company had no involvement in the legal woes of Brian Kahn, a former client who drew scrutiny from US authorities for his role in the 2020 collapse of a hedge fund.The Wednesday filing eases some pressure on B. Riley, whose stock lost about two-thirds of its value after short sellers aired concerns about its relationship with Kahn. At the same time, the report provided fodder for investors who’ve criticized the firm’s ability to track its own finances and the failure to disclose key details of its transactions.The jitters were amplified when B. Riley missed the deadline to file its audited results in March, and it needed an extension from its lenders to finish the job. When the report finally emerged, B. Riley’s auditors criticized the bank’s controls over its financial reporting, and B. Riley said it might need the rest of the year to fix them.“We acknowledge the complexities of our business are a result of an aggressive acquisition and investment strategy that has meaningfully diversified our platform,” Chief Executive Officer Bryant Riley said in a statement. “We are continuing to strengthen our processes and procedures to ensure we are best positioned to capitalize on the substantial market opportunities in front of us.”The stock surged 25% to $27.24 at 11:41 a.m. in New York and traded as high as $35.Among the problems cited by auditors at Marcum LLP was B. Riley’s ability to gauge investment valuations, one of the key criticisms lodged by short sellers who’ve been betting against the stock. Marcum said management’s review procedures lacked “a level of precision sufficient to prevent or detect a potential material misstatement in the consolidated statements.”Related PartiesStory continuesMarcum also called out efforts “to properly identify and disclose material related party transactions,” a category that can include deals with people who have close ties to the company or its personnel and might pose conflicts of interest. This, too, has drawn scrutiny from short sellers who said such ties can result in sweetheart deals that hurt shareholders.Elsewhere in the annual report, B. Riley detailed its dealings with Brian Kahn and acknowledged the risk that fallout from their prior relationship may continue to hurt B. Riley’s business, results of operations and its stock price. The firm said it redid an internal investigation with the help of a new law firm, Winston & Strawn, which reaffirmed that the bank has no ties to any alleged misconduct of Kahn in the collapse of Prophecy Asset Management. Still, B. Riley said the matter may trigger further “adverse effects on our business.”Read More: SEC Probes B. Riley Deals With Client Tied to Failed FundA previous internal probe that reached the same conclusion had been done by Sullivan & Cromwell. Short sellers had called for a new one because that law firm’s prior work for B. Riley presented a potential conflict of interest.Kahn has categorically denied any wrongdoing and said he was among those who lost money when Prophecy collapsed. He hasn’t been charged with anything by US authorities.The new report and statements didn’t satisfy some of those who’ve been betting against the stock.“Marcum decided to enclose new risk factors and call Kahn a related party, which is everything the skeptics have been saying,” short seller Marc Cohodes said by email. The firm still has “mismarked assets and related-party dealings that don’t pass the sniff test.”Paper LossesWednesday’s rally dealt roughly $100 million of paper losses to short sellers when the stock was up by $10, according to S3 Partners director Matthew Unterman. Bearish bettors were already in the red for 2024, largely because of the high costs to borrow shares for shorting. Short interest amounted to more than 60% of the stock’s float, according to S3 data.Read More: Franchise Group Inc. Lenders Tap Gibson Dunn Amid Kahn DealingsBefore Wednesday’s filing, shares of B. Riley had plunged amid concern about its deals with Kahn, who has been blamed in court papers by some investors for Prophecy’s collapse. The fund’s demise has been the subject of a federal investigation, and a key executive there pleaded guilty to fraud charges in November. Kahn has been tagged by authorities as an unindicted co-conspirator, Bloomberg reported.While Kahn was managing money for Prophecy, he acquired a controlling stake in Franchise Group, a collection of retail chains that he later took private with help from B. Riley. Short sellers contend that the Prophecy fraud case casts doubt on the validity of his ownership in Franchise Group and could impair B.

Wednesday, HOOKIPA Pharma Inc (NASDAQ:HOOK) received clearance from the FDA for its Investigational New Drug (IND) application for HB-700, a novel arenaviral therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of KRAS-mutated cancers.

In January, Roche terminated the collaboration and licensing agreement for HOOKIPA’s HB-700 program in KRAS mutated cancers.

HOOKIPA’s HB-700 program is designed to treat KRAS-mutated lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and other cancers by targeting the five most prevalent KRAS mutations in these disease indications: G12D, G12V, G12R, G12C, and G13D.

The company says the program can benefit more patients than single mutation inhibitors.

The IND submission achieves a final $10 million milestone payment from Roche Holdings AG (OTC:RHHBY).

Effective April 25, 2024, the company will regain full control of the associated intellectual property portfolio and have full collaboration and licensing rights for the HB-700 program.

The company will publish preclinical data in an abstract at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2024 Annual Meeting.

“We are proud to have another IND cleared for a potentially powerful oncology program. Our HB-700 program targets five KRAS mutations found in multiple cancer indications with a single product candidate,” said Joern Aldag, Chief Executive Officer at HOOKIPA.

Earlier this year, HOOKIPA Pharma announced to focus its resources on prioritizing the clinical development of a randomized trial for its HB-200 program in human papillomavirus 16 positive (HPV16+) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and its two Gilead Science Inc (NASDAQ:GILD) -partnered infectious disease cure programs for hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus.

Price Action: HOOK shares are up 1.29% at $0.75 at the last check Wednesday.

            +9.52% ","Opening day saw the value of Trump Media & Technology Group stock at almost $80; as of Tuesday it was trading at $32.57.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters

Former president Donald Trump qualified for a bonus worth $1.2bn after shares in his social media company remained above a certain value despite falling sharply.

Related: Trump has dodged financial calamity – for the time being | Lloyd Green

Trump is poised to receive 36m additional shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), owner of his Truth Social platform, under an “earn-out” windfall which boosts the paper value of his stake in the business to about $3.7bn.

He was able to receive the bonus if TMTG’s stock traded above $17.50 a share for 20 days out of any 30-day period within the first three years of the firm’s stock market debut – a milestone it reached after closing at $32.57 on Tuesday.

Trump’s shares in his social media company have offered him a financial lifeline as he faces about $500m in legal penalties after being found liable in civil fraud, defamation and sexual abuse cases. While he cannot sell his stock until September due to the terms of a lockup agreement, the shares’ fluctuating value have at times made him one of the world’s wealthiest people on paper.

Interactive

After a stunning landing on New York’s Nasdaq stock exchange, the value of Trump’s social media company – which trades as DJT – has fallen drastically. The stock hit a high of almost $80 on its opening day, but declined in fits in the following weeks.

Trump Media’s CEO, Devin Nunes, has suggested that short sellers betting on the loss of value may have been responsible for manipulating the stock.

Shares in Trump Media tanked further last week, falling 12% after the company revealed it could sell millions of additional shares in the coming months. They fell another 8% on Tuesday, even as they enabled Trump to qualify for his earn-out shares.

The company has also faced political scrutiny over the firm’s financial backers. A Democratic-aligned group issued a call earlier this month for lawmakers to investigate the company over allegations of influence peddling, after the Guardian reported that a Russian-American businessman under federal criminal investigation helped prop up the company.

Truth Social has become a personal soapbox for Trump to issue statements to his supporters since its launch in 2022. While its user base is tiny compared with more established social networks, such as X (formerly Twitter), the platform has outgrown other rightwing apps.

Trump is now on trial in a Manhattan courtroom, with prosecutors alleging that he sought to undermine the 2016 presidential election through making illegal hush-money payments to cover up his affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump’s defense lawyers have maintained he is innocent of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business documents, in what is the first criminal trial of a former president in US history.

Heat is a massive issue inside data centers and inadequate cooling can limit how fast the centers can grow.The company earned $0.43 per share in the quarter on revenue of $1.64 billion, surpassing Wall Street's consensus estimate for $0.36 per share in earnings on sales of $1.62 billion.

""Though still in its early stages, AI is quickly becoming a pervasive theme across our end markets.""Vertiv expects to earn between $2.29 and $2.35 per share for the year, suggesting some potential upside to the consensus $2.30 per share estimate.Is Vertiv stock a buy following a strong earnings report?Vertiv stock is up nearly 600% over the past year. The forecast is bullish but the company will have to deliver on it, as investors are pricing a lot of future growth into the shares right now.As Vertiv matures, it is fine-tuning its cash-generation engine, increasing net cash generated from operating activities by $96 million year over year to $138 million. It is using some of that cash on buybacks, repurchasing $600 million worth of shares in the quarter despite the elevated prices.Vertiv is a great backdoor way to invest in the AI boom, and if the sector continues to grow, the stock can appreciate from here. But investors should steel themselves for some sort of deceleration up ahead that could impact enthusiasm.

            +0.02% ","(Bloomberg) -- Stock market investors who have been reluctant to hedge their portfolios in the face of this year’s gains are starting to reconsider that strategy.Most Read from BloombergBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll ShowsTaylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is BrokenTech Giants Hit in Late Hours After Meta’s Outlook: Markets WrapMeta Projects Higher Spending in Deeper Push Into AIBiden’s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House LawnHeightened geopolitical risks are stoking market fear as Middle East tensions intensify, while the realities of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates higher for longer are starting to settle in, sending the S&P 500 Index down 3.2% for April and putting it on pace for its first monthly loss since October. The mounting uncertainties have traders buying put options that pay off if stocks keep tumbling.“It’s not too late to protect against further risk escalation,” said Nitin Saksena, head of US equity derivatives research at Bank of America. “You have to be a little bit thoughtful about how you hedge, and where you hedge.”Read More: US Stock Volatility Resurfaces Amid Tensions in the Middle EastTake Mike and Matt Thompson, portfolio managers at Little Harbor Advisors in Marblehead, Massachusetts. The brothers said they don’t always maintain hedges, but over the past couple of weeks, they’ve bought VIX futures to protect against a spike in volatility.“We’re at a yellow light,” Mike Thompson said, “a time to be cautious and accumulate some protection.”On Friday, the Cboe Volatility Index — also known as the VIX, which is a measure of the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 — traded above the key 20 marker for the first time in six months and hit its highest level since October. The index is on track to close above its 200-day moving average for 15 consecutive sessions, its longest streak since October 2022.The rising demand for insurance is driving up costs on broad market hedges that pay off if stocks fall further, and that’s been particularly evident in contracts that expire in a few months. A gauge of implied volatility in a 25-delta put expiring in June, for instance, has jumped as much as 30% since late March, signaling traders’ desire for near-term hedges.Cheap OptionsThe higher premiums are coming off historical lows, as broad market hedges sold for their cheapest in years to start the year. In general the cost of options contracts remain very low. So investors concerned about anything — geopolitics, elections, earnings — still have time to grab cheap insurance.Story continuesWhat form that protection takes depends on the trader. While the Little Harbor brothers turned to VIX futures, BofA’s Saksena noted that one-year put options and put spreads tied to the S&P 500 are cheap, with prices in the bottom decile over the past 15 years.Puts connected to Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (ticker QQQ), which profit if the Nasdaq 100 dives, are among the plays favored by Michael Purves at Tallbacken Capital. His logic is simply “if you think that pan-asset selling is coming, then what rallied the most will be sold the most,” he said.For professional hedgers and portfolio managers alike, the question of insurance comes down to where the buyer thinks the equities selloff is right now. If a trader believes stocks are on the cusp of a rebound, why bother hedging?The risk, of course, is the unforeseen suddenly appearing. While Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management Americas, does not believe a stock market collapse is imminent, she thinks equities could prove sensitive to negative news, particularly with valuations still elevated. That’s where a little insurance can be beneficial.“We tell our clients that if they’re nervous about markets, it’s better to put some hedges in place versus selling out completely,” said Marcelli.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ LenderBig Junk Food’s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for DinnerHow a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation’s SecretsStudio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount MergerChina’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments (1)"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tethers-stablecoin-dominance-may-wane-155135763.html,Tether's Stablecoin Dominance May Wane Following Proposed U.S. Rules: S&P,"Wed, Apr 24, 2024, 10:51 AM CDT",,"Regulatory clarity should encourage banks to enter the stablecoin market, S&P said.

Tether could see its dominance wane if the stablecoin bill is approved, the report said.

New digital asset custody providers could emerge leading to greater competition.

Regulatory clarity in the U.S. should inspire banks from the traditional financial world to enter the stablecoin market and may also reduce the dominance of Tether's USDT, S&P Global Ratings said in a report on Wednesday.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that serves as bedrock in crypto markets. U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced a new stablecoin bill last week that seeks to define how stablecoins will operate in the country.

The U.S. dollar is the most popular peg for stablecoins, but most stablecoin issuers aren't subject to specific U.S. regulations, the report said. This could change following the introduction of the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act last week.

""The new rules may offer banks a competitive advantage by limiting institutions without a banking license to a maximum issuance of $10 billion,"" analyst Andrew O'Neill wrote.

Tether's USDT has a market capitalization of $110 billion, making it the third-biggest cryptocurrency, according to CoinDesk data. Circle's USDC is in second place among stablecoins at $34 billion. Both track the U.S. dollar.

""An approval of the stablecoin bill would accelerate institutional blockchain innovation, in particular for tokenization or digital bond issuances involving on-chain payments,"" O'Neill said, adding that the ""growth of institutional use cases for stablecoins would create opportunities for banks as stablecoin issuers and may also reduce tether's dominance in the global stablecoin market.""

S&P said that USDT is issued by a non-U.S. entity and therefore is not a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill. This means that U.S. entities can't hold or transact in it, which could reduce USDT's demand while at the same time giving a boost to U.S.-issued stablecoins. Still, USDT transaction activity is located mainly outside the U.S. in emerging markets and is driven by retail investors and remittances, the report noted.

""New providers of digital asset custody services could emerge with the removal of the SEC's requirement that custodians report digital assets on their balance sheet,"" the report added, and this could lead to greater competition.

S&P previously critiqued USDT for being worse than rivals at doing its core task: being valued at $1.

The media streaming stock is on track for its fifth loss in six sessions, dragging it 8.3% lower this quarter. Still, NFLX boasts a 14.4% year-to-date lead and an even better 72.7% year-over-year gain, and this latest pullback has it near a historically bullish trendline that could soon catapult it higher.More specifically, Netflix stock just came within one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average, after trading above this trendline since November. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, six similar signals occurred during the past three years. One month after 67% of said signals, NFLX enjoyed a 10.3% gain.

            -3.33% ","Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) business has been in decline in recent years. The company was a king in the chip market, dominating central processing units (CPUs) alongside a lucrative partnership with Apple. However, an onslaught of new competition and the end of its relationship with Apple forced the company to rethink its business model.Intel's shares are down about 28% in the last two years as the market noted Intel's headwinds. In response these challenges, Intel has launched a massive transformation that could make it an excellent long-term investment.The tech giant is shifting its business to prioritize a digital foundry model, which will likely see it become the biggest semiconductor company in the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, Intel is investing heavily in the budding artificial intelligence (AI) industry.So, here's why Intel is a no-brainer buy right now.A leading recipient of the CHIPS ActTwo years ago, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPs Act, an initiative meant to expand the country's semiconductor manufacturing capacity by investing $53 billion into some of the world's top chipmakers. And funding is finally beginning to be dispersed.On April 15, the Biden administration announced plans to award Samsung $6.4 billion to expand its manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Intel will likely follow soon. There is $8.5 billion earmarked for Intel, which will help it build four new facilities throughout the country.The chips will make it easier and more cost-effective for U.S. tech companies to build a wide range of devices, including consumer products, cars, data centers and hardware meant for AI.Intel said last year the shift to an internal foundry model will save it up to $10 billion by 2025 and will be its ""most significant transformation in its 55-year history."" Additionally, the tech giant revealed the change could increase efficiency and profitability, potentially allowing it to achieve 60% in non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin and 40% in operating margin.Intel is gradually expanding its position in the $200 billion AI marketIn addition to a significant shift in its business model, Intel is making AI a major focus in many of its products.The AI market reached a valuation of just under $200 billion last year yet is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030. Dozens of tech companies have pivoted their businesses to the high-growth segment in an effort to cash in on AI's massive potential. And Intel has followed suit.Yet what sets Intel apart is its long history in the chip market, with its 55 years of experience as a chipmaker. In fact, the company is responsible for 63% of the CPU market despite the rise of rivals like Advanced Micro Devices.Story continuesIntel is slightly late to the AI party, with much of its past focused on CPUs. Meanwhile, graphics process units (GPUs) are predominantly needed to build AI models. Consequently, GPU leader Nvidia's business has exploded over the last year, without much competition. However, Intel plans to challenge Nvidia's market share with its own AI GPUs in 2024.Last year, Intel unveiled its Gaudi 3 AI GPUs. The chips launched this April, with the company announcing they beat Nvidia's GPUs by 50% in inference and 40% in power efficiency.Intel could profit from the AI market's tailwinds for years, making its stock an exciting option this month. One of the best-valued AI stocks aroundThe Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index is up around 40% in the last 12 months, driven primarily by excitement over AI. However, the market's projected growth indicates it's not too late to invest.Meanwhile, chip stocks are some of the best ways to invest in AI, with these companies developing the hardware that makes the generative technology possible.<img alt=""AMD PE Ratio (Forward) Chart"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lHwpWFOvGX_JlCuESdnt8Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTc2NztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/dd6a9ddcfffc5b7f084a938e96fc83e8 class=caas-img>AMD PE Ratio (Forward) ChartThis chart shows Intel as potentially the best-valued AI chip stock. Intel's forward price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios are significantly lower than those of fellow chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.These figures make Intel a bargain compared to its competitors. With the company transitioning to a digital foundry model and expanding its position in AI, Intel's stock is worth considering before it's too late.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

The bank’s US Tactical Positioning Monitor, which measures clients’ exposure to American equities, hit a level that reflects an “attractive set-up” for the S&P 500 Index, according to a note Wednesday from a team led by Andrew Tyler, JPMorgan’s head of US market intelligence. The stock gauge has historically gained around 3% in the subsequent 20 days after a similar four-week change in positioning, compared to a roughly 1% gain in all periods, according to the note.

US stocks are up so far this week as solid corporate results lifted the S&P 500. The index is coming off a three-week slide spurred by worries that interest rates will remain elevated for months to come. The focus this week is on technology behemoths, with results from Meta Platforms Inc. due after the close Wednesday and Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. on deck Thursday. Friday brings the latest reading of a key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and investors will be looking for signs price pressures are cooling.

“The tactical bounce appears poised to continue with the keys being megacap tech earnings and PCE releases this week,” Tyler wrote. “Should all of these hit, you may see markets overshoot to the upside but feels like buy-the-dip has kicked in.”

He said the current setup is akin to that of August and October, when US stocks also staged subsequent comebacks.

Earlier this week, the bank’s chief market strategist, Marko Kolanovic, said in a note to clients that the selloff in stocks isn’t over yet as macroeconomic risks mount, including rising bond yields and elevated oil prices.

While it’s not unusual for firms to have different views under one roof, the disconnect at JPMorgan has popped up since last year. In August, for example, the trading desk team called for all-time highs on the S&P 500 at a time when Kolanovic was sticking to a bearish stance. Kolanovic represents JPMorgan’s house view.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-stock-price-surging-150257277.html,Why Tesla’s stock price is surging — here’s what Elon Musk said,"Wed, Apr 24, 2024, 10:02 AM CDT",,"Tesla shares have had a rough start to 2024, but are surging following its first quarter earnings report on Tuesday where the electric vehicle manufacturer said it wanted to accelerate plans for offering more affordable models. The stock was up about 13 percent in early morning trading.

Tesla’s (TSLA) first quarter results were disappointing, with revenues down 9 percent from 2023 to $21.3 billion and net income down 55 percent to $1.1 billion. Its stock had fallen more than 40 percent so far in 2024 prior to the first quarter report.

But investors seem encouraged by the company’s plans to accelerate the launch of new models, including more affordable options. Tesla previously had targeted the second half of 2025, but said it was moving up those plans to early 2025 or late 2024.

“These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and we’ll be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said. “So it’s not contingent upon any new factory or massive new production line.”

Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein raised his fair value estimate for Tesla shares to $200 following the first quarter results and views the shares as undervalued.

“Tesla’s affordable vehicles are a catalyst for shares,” Goldstein wrote in a note to clients. “Affordable vehicles should eventually generate a majority of its total deliveries. We continue to forecast that Tesla delivers around 5 million vehicles by 2030.”

Tesla’s robotaxi to be called ‘cybercab’

Musk also shared plans about the company’s progress towards autonomous vehicles and said it planned to showcase a robotaxi or “cybercab” in August.

“I mean if somebody doesn’t believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said.

Tesla has faced challenges as demand has slowed for EVs across the industry and competition from Chinese automakers increased. Earlier this month, Tesla said it would reduce its global workforce by more than 10 percent and two executives left the company.

            -2.87% ","Boeing (NYSE: BA) burned through $3.9 billion in cash in the first quarter on its way to posting a substantial loss. But analysts had feared things would be even worse than they were.Following the release of the company's quarterly results, Boeing shares opened Wednesday's trading session up by 5% and remained in the green by 2.6% as of 10:41 ET.Terrible, as expectedBoeing's issues are by now well known. The aerospace giant has stumbled from crisis to crisis since the 2019 grounding of its 737 MAX following a pair of fatal crashes. Boeing today faces serious questions about its engineering and manufacturing practices as they relate not just to the MAX, but also the 787 Dreamliner and 777X, and both regulators and customers are cracking down. Investors went into the quarterly report expecting the company to put up massive losses due to delivery holds and compensation to customers for jet groundings.The company did lose $1.13 per share in Q1 on revenue of $16.6 billion, but that was better than the $1.65 per share loss on sales of $15.22 billion that Wall Street analysts had, on average, expected. Boeing's cash flow for the period was a negative $3.9 billion, nearly $600 million less in burn than the consensus estimate.In the earnings release, Boeing management said it is ""undertaking comprehensive actions in our commercial business to strengthen quality and safety,"" and noted that the company still had $7.5 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books as of quarter's end.Is Boeing a buy after its quarterly beat?The bull case for Boeing rests heavily on the fact that the company has a backlog of more than 5,600 commercial plane orders valued at $529 billion. If Boeing can deliver on those orders and pay down its $47.9 billion in debt, there is a clear path for the stock to rise from here.The question is how soon will those deliveries happen, and that will come down to how quickly the company can rebuild its bruised reputation and earn the nod from regulators to get back to business as usual. That will likely take most of 2024 -- assuming no new issues emerge. It's hard to imagine the stock heading meaningfully higher until Boeing puts its issues firmly behind it.The company has ample cash on the books and a $10 billion untapped credit line to fall back on. But until Boeing shows it remembers how to fly safely, new investors should hold off boarding.Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boeing wasn’t one of them.

            +0.52% EBGEF
            -0.28% KO
            +1.50% ^GSPC
            +0.02% ","If you're a retiree, it's a good time to think about transitioning from growth stocks into safer dividend investments. Not only can they provide you with more stability, but the dividend income they generate can be crucial to help pay bills and provide you with more money to make your retirement years much more enjoyable. Three high-yielding stocks that are great options for retirees today are Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB).Coca-ColaCoca-Cola has a strong brand that consumers around the world have been familiar with for many years. Amid inflation, it has been able to pass along rising costs to consumers without a big drop in demand. Last year, the company's net revenue rose by 6% to $45.8 billion. And its operating margin of 24.7% was only slightly lower than the 25.4% it achieved in the previous year. For 2024, the business still looks poised for more growth, with Coca-Cola anticipating that its revenue will grow organically by 6% to 7%. Meanwhile, its per-share earnings will rise by at least 8% when excluding the impact of foreign currency. The company's strength and versatility has been on full display over the past few years as Coca-Cola has weathered the effects of some challenging economic conditions and still delivered strong results. Earlier this year, Coca-Cola also announced it was raising its dividend for a 62nd consecutive year. The Dividend King makes for an ideal option for retirees who want a solid income investment. At 3.2%, Coca-Cola's current yield is more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.4%.Realty IncomeAnother good dividend stock for retirees is Realty Income. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has some excellent diversification, which can provide retirees with good long-term stability. While it has a broad exposure to many industries, grocery stores account for 11% of its annualized contractual rent, followed by convenience stores at 10%. Dollar stores, home improvement stores, drug stores, and restaurants are other key industries in Realty Income's portfolio.REITs haven't been popular buys in recent years due to rising interest rates; income investors have been looking at other income-generating assets instead. But interest rates are likely to come down in the future, it's just a matter of when. And once that happens, Realty Income could become a hot buy again.Last year, the REIT's funds from operations, or FFO, was $4.07 per share, which was up slightly from the $4.04 it reported a year earlier. Despite challenging economic conditions, Realty Income has demonstrated excellent resiliency. FFO is a key metric REITs use to assess their performance and profitability and to determine whether their dividend is safe. In Realty Income's case, investors don't have much to worry about these days.Story continuesRealty Income's 5.8% can provide retirees with a solid source of recurring income. And with the stock down 15% over the past year, investors can buy in at a discount. The REIT has also increased its monthly dividend a whopping 124 times since 1994.EnbridgeThe highest yield on this list comes from Canada-based pipeline company Enbridge. Its 7.7% yield means you would need to invest just $13,000 into the oil and gas stock to collect an annual dividend of $1,000. By comparison, you would need to invest more than $71,000 to get the same payout if you bought shares of the average S&P 500 stock. Enbridge's high yield isn't cause for concern as the business is in fine shape. The company relies on long-term contracts, which provide it with some great stability. Enbridge boasts that it has met its financial guidance for 18 straight years. In 2023, its adjusted earnings of 5.7 billion Canadian dollars were unchanged from the previous year. The company has been pursuing acquisitions to strengthen its financials and pad its top and bottom lines in the future. And in doing so, it has rewarded investors; the company has increased its dividend for 29 consecutive years. At a multiple of 17 times earnings, Enbridge makes for an excellent value buy right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

            +0.18% ","It's been a good year for Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) investors. The stock hit a 52-week high after its blowout financial update in February. The shares have pulled back lately, but with a 26% year-to-date gain, it's easily trouncing the market averages.It's a welcome break. The media giant's shares have lost to the S&P 500 in each of three previous years. There are some good reasons to expect the streak to turn positive this year. Let's go over some of the reasons the House of Mouse could be a smart investment right now.1. Disney+ is no longer a negativeIt was a hot start to Disney+ after the late-2019 launch that helped drive the shares to an all-time high in early 2021. It's the massive losses for the premium streaming service that have weighed on the shares since then. Disney's direct-to-consumer segment -- the business that includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ -- posted a whopping $4 billion operating deficit in fiscal 2022. Its health is improving dramatically on that front.The segment's $138 million operating loss in the first fiscal quarter of 2024 is a lot better than the $984 million deficit it checked in with a year earlier. CEO Bob Iger expects Disney+ to be profitable by the September quarter of this year. Bundling, higher prices for ad-free tiers, and a new thriving ad-supported plan for Disney+ have helped boost the top line. Disney's cost cuts have helped at the other end.<img alt=""Celebrities taking a selfie with a Disney princess."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eiXsb6SoXiwPUry8yM7fUw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/c6757cd79abc6cc7ae872c0fed2eb19b class=caas-img>Image source: Disney.2. Get ready to bounce back at the box officeIt's been a quiet start this year at the local multiplex for Disney, but unlike last year's disappointing showing, 2024's softness is by design. Disney doesn't have any of the 24 highest-grossing domestic theatrical releases this year. Its only notable film this year has been The First Omen, which has cleared a pedestrian $18 million in admissions since premiering earlier this month.All of this is about to change. There is a potential blockbuster coming out nearly every month through the end of this calendar year.May 10: Kingdom of the Planet of the ApesJune 14: Inside Out 2July 26: Deadpool & WolverineAug. 16: Alien: RomulusOct. 18: A Real PainNov. 27: Moana 2Dec. 20: Mufasa: The Lion KingThey won't all be nine-figure winners. They don't need to be. Disney just needs a couple of films in its 2024 slate to succeed to make investors forget about Disney's disappointing 2023 performance at the box office.3. Disney believes in DisneyPositioning itself for success in the proxy battle that ended in Disney's favor three weeks ago, the entertainment leader did a lot of things to make itself more appealing to shareholders and even opposing activists. One thing the board did earlier this year was authorize up to $3 billion in share repurchases. This is Disney's first buyback in six years.Story continuesThe stock may not seem conventionally cheap. It's trading for 26 times this year's Wall Street profit target and 22 times next year's analyst forecast. However, Disney has now posted three consecutive quarters of accelerating earnings beats. Put another way, Disney is increasing its lead over the lowballing analysts shrinking in its rearview mirror. This is a great time to repurchase your shares, boosting your per-share profitability in the process.4. It's spending money while saving someDisney is getting prudent with its costs, even beyond the push to make Disney+ profitable within the next five months. It turned heads a year ago when it announced plans to achieve $5.5 billion in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2024. Now it expects to exceed $7.5 billion. However, it's still willing to spend where it matters.Disney recently announced a $1.5 billion investment in Fortnite creator Epic Games. A knock on Disney 30 years ago was that it was primarily a player in family entertainment. It didn't offer much for families with older kids. In 1996, it acquired the media mogul that owned both ABC and a majority stake in ESPN. It has gone on to snap up Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox, producing some of Hollywood's biggest movies over the past few years. Why wouldn't it want a strategic stake in a gaming company for which 85% of players are under 35?Despite the cutbacks, Disney also didn't have a problem announcing a few months ago that it would be doubling its investment to $60 million over the next 10 years for its theme parks, cruise lines, and other experiences. This has been Disney's most resilient business, and one that requires theme park updates and bar-raising ships to keep drawing guests at higher price points.5. The improvements are everywhereThe weak spots in Disney's armor are starting to get patched up. Bears love to gnaw away at the cost-heavy ESPN, but that business just posted a surprising operating profit in Disney's latest report. Its legacy networks business should get an ad boost this year as political spot spending sees a surge heading into the November elections.It's not just ESPN that's learning how to win the big game. Disney+ posted a 9% increase in average monthly revenue per paid account in its latest quarter. Disney not only reinstated its dividend late last year but also increased the rate of its semiannual payouts by 50% for the next distribution.Disney surprised analysts earlier this year in a rare case of offering guidance. With the contested annual shareholder meeting weeks away, it's probably not a coincidence that Disney was chattier than usual in its February earnings call, but it had something impressive to say. Disney expects its annual adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2024 to climb at least 20%, to $4.60 or better. Wall Street pros were perched at $4.27 a share at the time, and even now, the consensus remains at $4.40 a share.The upside for the leading media stock is hiding in plain sight. Now's the time to buy Disney stock like there's no tomorrow -- or Tomorrowland.Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walt Disney wasn’t one of them.

            -0.52% ","How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Ahead Of Q1 EarningsMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is scheduled to post earnings results for its first quarter, after the closing bell on Wednesday.Analysts expect the Menlo Park, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at $4.32 per share, up from $2.20 per share in the year-ago period. Meta is projected to report quarterly revenue of $36.16 billion, up from $28.64 billion in the same quarter last year, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Meta has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in six straight quarters.On April 22, Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson maintained Meta Platforms with an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $575 to $555, while JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone reiterated the stock with a Market Outperform and maintained a $550 price target.With the recent buzz around Meta Platforms, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Meta Platforms has a dividend yield of 0.40%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 50 cents a share ($2.00 a year).To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Meta Platforms, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).Next, we take this amount and divide it by Meta's $2.00 dividend: $6,000 / $2.00  = 3,000 sharesSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,488,300 worth of Meta Platforms, or 3,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.00 = 600 shares, or $297,660 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.View more earnings on METAAlso Read: Investor Sentiment Improves Further, Dow Jumps Over 250 PointsNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.Story continuesMETA Price Action: Shares of Meta Platforms rose 3% to close at $496.10 on Tuesday.Read More: Tesla, Boeing And 3 Stocks To Watch Heading Into WednesdayPhoto: Shutterstock""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

            +0.96% ","French fries remain an undisputed staple in the American eatery experience. They're ordered eight times as often as the next most popular side or appetizer in the United States. Despite the side's popularity, a product as common as french fries doesn't generally elicit thoughts of market-beating returns.Nevertheless, Lamb Weston (NYSE: LW) aims to prove that this outperformance is possible thanks to its leadership position in the frozen potato products niche. In fact, between 2016 and 2023, Lamb Weston delivered a total return more than double that of the S&P 500 Index.However, following a few quarters of less-than-appetizing earnings that saw the company's capital expenditures (capex) skyrocket, Lamb Weston's stock price has plunged by 30% from its highs.So is Lamb Weston a ""falling knife"" that investors should avoid catching, with its capex spending spiraling out of control? Or is the french fry juggernaut a steady dividend grower available at a once-in-a-decade valuation? Here's why I'm thinking the latter.Going global with America's favorite side dishBuilding upon its leadership position in North America's frozen potato products industry, Lamb Weston is turning its attention to the international markets. Despite already being the second-largest business in the frozen potato category outside North America, Lamb Weston's international unit only accounted for 15% of the company's total sales in 2022.On an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis, this figure was an even lower 10% of the company's total EBITDA. However, management expects its newly formed international unit (all countries except the U.S., Canada, and Mexico) to account for roughly 34% of sales and 20% of adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2024, roughly doubling its 2022 totals.These international growth ambitions are where the company's incredible ramp-up in capex over the last few quarters comes from.<img alt=""LW Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/q0F3nTx52jAykqWwn1tbgA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzMTtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/2706501c4ff6bed225373a46ef15ff41 class=caas-img>LW Cash from Operations (TTM) ChartAfter the company expanded its manufacturing capacity at plants in the Netherlands and Argentina while building a new facility in China, Lamb Weston's capex has temporarily risen above its cash from operations, resulting in a negative free cash flow (FCF). While these expansion plans could pay huge future dividends by streamlining the company's global supply chain and allowing it to serve higher-growth markets better, this short-term pain creates a murkier investment thesis.Making matters worse, the company is simultaneously transitioning to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. And to be brutally honest, this switch hasn't gone well so far in North America. In the third quarter alone, this ERP transition affected sales volume by a negative 8% due to ""reduced visibility into finished goods inventories at its distribution centers, resulting in a higher-than-expected effect on customer order fulfillment rates.""Story continuesWhile management believes it has adjusted its deployment plans enough to avoid issues like this in the future (the transition is a multi-year process), investors will need to monitor for any further financial effects closely.So why is now the time to buy Lamb Weston, you may be thinking? Let me explain.<img alt=""People sitting around a dinner table eating a meal together, with one holding a french fry."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NnhmQFU4ryqXNNPxL0LF.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/3510b68233fb81fdff7df1e4b6428579 class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.A buy at its once-in-a-decade valuationCurrently trading with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 1.8, Lamb Weston's valuation is the lowest it has been since it spun off from Conagra in 2016.<img alt=""LW PS Ratio Chart"" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SLoYlh8080uvVq1vhD9nYA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU4ODtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/4e035062347d5890e8259a8031673d78 class=caas-img>LW PS Ratio ChartIf Lamb Weston returns to the 11% FCF margin it averaged in ""normal"" operating times between 2016 and 2022, it would be trading at a mere 16 times FCF. Using a reverse discounted cash flow model, we can find that a company trading at this valuation would only need to grow FCF by 4% annually to equal the market's historical growth rate of 10% annually (assuming a 3% terminal rate).This ever-so-slightly above inflation 4% growth rate means the market expects Lamb Weston to see no further sales volume growth. Management, however, anticipates frozen potato demand to grow by 3% globally over the long term. This steady, albeit small, growth rate should help Lamb Weston soar past the market's meager expectations for the company, especially as it passes along gradual price increases similar to the inflation rate.Best yet for investors? Lamb Weston's 1.5% dividend yield only uses 15% of the company's net income, leaving ample room for a seventh consecutive year of dividend increases and beyond.With management projecting high-single-digit earnings growth rates over the long term -- while the market has the company priced for only 4% growth -- Lamb Weston looks like an undeniably steady operator with market-beating potential.Should you invest $1,000 in Lamb Weston right now?Before you buy stock in Lamb Weston, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lamb Weston wasn’t one of them.

            +1.27% ","Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are down 13% year to date. The company is facing several headwinds right now, including weak iPhone sales in China and increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe.Despite these headwinds, Wells Fargo has an overweight (buy) rating on the shares with a $225 price target. That's 35% higher than Apple's current share price of $166.90.Is Apple stock a buy?In the company's fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30, 2023), iPhone sales grew in every region except China. But analysts expect Apple to report a 5% year-over-year decline in revenue for the fiscal second quarter.Apple is expected to launch generative artificial intelligence (AI) features for iOS later this year, which could stimulate iPhone demand, but investors are worried about the cost of these new features. Analysts expect Apple to post earnings per share of $1.50 for fiscal Q2, slightly down from $1.52 in the year-ago period.Another cloud hanging over Apple stock right now is regulation. In March, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit alleging that Apple is monopolizing the smartphone market with certain contractual restrictions placed on app developers. Meanwhile, the European Union is trying to force Apple to offer users alternative ways to buy content in the App Store.Overall, these headwinds may continue to negatively impact investor sentiment around the stock in the near term, but these issues don't impact the value of Apple's brand.The stock's valuation still isn't cheap on a price-to-earnings basis, and with Apple likely facing another quarter of soft iPhone sales, investors shouldn't expect the stock to reach the analyst's price target anytime soon. However, stronger iPhone sales in calendar 2025, especially if Apple releases new AI features, may be the catalyst that sends the share price higher.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

            +1.46% TRMB
            -0.30% ","Market sentiment can shift fast, as seen in recent sessions. The tech rally that had been the driving force behind the past year’s gains appeared to stall earlier this month, but the markets have been in bullish mode once more since the start of the week.In an uncertain situation like this, investors need a quality data analysis tool, to make sense of the rapidly changing conditions. The Smart Score, from TipRanks, fits that bill, using AI-powered natural language algorithms to sift through the huge volume of daily trading data, and winnow out the top-scoring stocks. Every stock is compared to a set of factors that have proven reliable as predictors of future performance and given a simple score on a scale of 1 to 10, with the ‘Perfect 10s’ indicating stocks that are primed for gains.We’ve gotten a start on this, looking at two stocks that have scored the Perfect 10 even amidst market uncertainty. According to the data, each stock also boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating and a double-digit upside. Here are their details, and comments from the Street’s analysts.Applied Materials (AMAT)We’ll start with Applied Materials, a tech company that provides vital support for the semiconductor chip industry, in the form of software and equipment. Applied Materials brings its engineering knowledge to play in high-tech manufacturing, providing solutions for both semiconductor chip companies and flat-screen display manufacturers. The company’s integrated circuit products are used in chip design and are found in a wide range of consumer electronics.This company works in a high-demand niche, with customers who are willing to pay a premium for quality – and that has been supportive of Applied Materials’ revenue. In the past several years, the quarterly top line has come in consistently between $6 billion and $7 billion, and the company had full-year revenues of $26.52 billion in its last fiscal year, 2023. Applied Materials currently has a market cap of $160.5 billion.In its last earnings report, for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (January quarter), Applied Materials had a top-line revenue total of $6.71 billion, relatively flat year-over-year and beating the forecast by $220 million. The company’s earnings, an EPS of $2.13 by non-GAAP measures, was 22 cents better than had been anticipated. The shares trended higher following the release and are up by 19% year-to-date (and 71.5% over the past year) even after a recent pullback over worries China is reducing chip imports.For Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis, who holds the #6 overall rating from TipRanks, the key point about Applied Materials is the company’s sound position in its industry. The 5-star analyst writes of AMAT, “Being a deposition market share leader, we think AMAT is well positioned to benefit from the SemiCap secular drivers, namely 1) Bigger chips; 2) Complex manufacturing; 3) Trailing Node Buildouts and 4) Semiconductor nationalization. We view AMAT as a particular beneficiary of increased demand for advanced packaging, trailing node demand, and Gate-All-Around and backside power chip architectures.”Story continuesLipacis goes on to put an Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, with a $260 price target that indicates his confidence in a 34.5% upside for the coming year. (To watch Lipacis’ track record, click here)This tech stock has picked up 24 recent analyst reviews, with a breakdown of 19 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell to back up the Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $193.24, and their $228.55 average price target suggests a one-year upside potential of 18%.

Trimble Navigation works with a wide range of industries, including building and construction, agriculture, government, transportation, utilities, and even specialties like geospatial imaging. The company’s products include items such as inertial navigation systems, global navigation satellite system receivers, aerial drones, laser rangefinders, and software processing tools to put all of this together.While the company’s background is in hardware, Trimble is shifting more towards services and system maintenance, vital niches in a digital world. The company is developing core technology offerings in positioning, connectivity, and data analytics, all in high demand by globally networked companies, and bills its services as a connection between the digital and physical worlds. Trimble’s solutions aim to improve function for its customers, from productivity to quality to sustainability, while keeping up safety standards.In an interesting move, Trimble announced on April 1 that it had closed a joint venture transaction with the agricultural giant AGCO. The joint venture is known as PTx Trimble and targets the agriculture technology niche, designed to provide an industry-leading agriculture platform, with precision factory fit and retro-fit applications for farmers globally. Trimble holds a 15% stake in the joint venture.When we look at Trimble’s last financial release, we see that the company generated $932.4 million at the top line in 4Q23. This was more than $20 million better than the estimates and was up almost 9% year-over-year. Trimble’s bottom line was reported as a non-GAAP earnings-per-share of 63 cents, 3 cents better than the forecast. The company had an annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of $1.98 billion at the end of Q4, a solid metric that bodes well for future business. The ARR was up 24% year-over-year.This stock caught the attention of analyst Kristen Owen, from Oppenheimer, who notes the solid ARR growth and the company’s strong sales. “Its next phase of growth will be driven by the business model evolution from discrete products to systems solutions, with the ability to sustain a significant portion of ARR growth within its existing customer base,” Owen said. “TRMB is also making it easier for customers to do business with it by realigning its go-to-market from product-based to account-based sales, which we believe can drive bottom-line re-acceleration as sales efficiency improves. We believe TRMB has a long runway of incremental catalysts including closing the AGCO JV, delevering/buybacks, resegmentation, continued portfolio refinement, and its 2H24 investor day.”All of this supports Owen’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, and her $72 price target implies that TRMB will appreciate by 20.5% this year. (To watch Owen’s track record, click here)There are 6 recent analyst reviews on this name, and the 5-to-1 split in favor of Buy over Hold gives the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $57.97 and the $66.80 average price target suggests an upside of 15% on the one-year horizon.

            +12.06% ","Caroline Woods brings the latest business headlines from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as markets open for trading on Wednesday, April 24.

Related: Elon Musk sparks a Tesla stock turnaround

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

I'm Caroline Woods reporting from the New York Stock Exchange — Here's what we're watching on TheStreet today.

Investors will be watching the latest read on inflation with Friday's release of the March PCE index. PCE is just one of the many data points the Fed will consider when making its next rates decision on April 30.

Wall Street is also reacting to key earnings out of Boeing and AT&T ahead of results from Meta and Chipotle after Wednesday's closing bell.

Continuing with earnings — Tesla (TSLA) once again caught Wall Street's full attention after the EV giant reported its steepest revenue loss since 2012 amid a broader decline in EV sales in the first quarter of 2024.

Tesla's net income of $1.13 billion marked a 55% decline from the same reporting period in 2023.

Tesla has faced increasing pressure over the last year from weak deliveries, increased competition in China, price cuts and high-profile executive departures.

Heading into the report, Tesla stock was down more than 40% so far in 2024.

However, Wall Street found the silver lining in the report. In a letter to investors, Tesla announced the production of smaller, cheaper EVS will begin sooner than expected.

The new models will be built using current Tesla platforms and production lines. CEO Elon Musk told analysts he expects production to begin by 2025, ""if not late this year.""

Musk used Tesla's earnings call to remind analyts there's more to Tesla than making cars. He said Tesla should be valued as an AI robotics company, reflecting his ongoing focus on the development of full self-driving technology.

That'll do it for your daily briefing. From the New York Stock Exchange, I'm Caroline Woods with TheStreet.

            +0.02% ","Many investors subscribe to the idea of index investing, but figuring out which index fund they should own can leave them somewhat paralyzed.Two common recommendations are the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEMKT: VTI) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). Both Vanguard funds earn high marks from index investors thanks to their low expense ratios and strong track record of matching their respective indexes. Either could provide a great foundation for a portfolio.Where they differ is in which index they track. The Total Stock Market fund tracks the CRSP US Total Market Index, which captures practically every investable U.S. stock in the market. The S&P 500 ETF tracks the S&P 500, which is a collection of about 500 of the largest U.S. companies that have been consistently profitable for at least a year.Deciding between the two can be a challenge. So, here's what you need to know.<img alt=""A person holding a tablet looking at a chart."" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YDEM3VTO5Q6ZaEXa1dVYjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/215738965a8221d8588221196e1a6d8b class=caas-img>Image source: Getty Images.There's a lot of overlap between the fundsBoth funds are weighted by market capitalization. That means the biggest U.S. companies like Microsoft and Apple make up a significant share of both portfolios. Meanwhile, smaller companies, like numbers 491 through 500 in the S&P 500 make up a much smaller share. As a result, there's a lot of overlap between the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.The top 10 holdings in each fund are the same.

Data as of 3/31/2024.Overall, 86% of the Total Stock Market ETF overlaps with the holdings in the S&P 500 ETF. As a result, the returns you can expect are very similar and highly correlated.That leaves 14% of the Total Stock Market ETF invested in stocks outside of the S&P 500. These are mid- and small-cap stocks, or large companies that have yet to meet the profitability criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. That amount of diversification is not insignificant, but it's not going to push the Total Stock Market ETF returns too far from the returns of the S&P 500 ETF.Factors to consider for every ETFThere are some other important factors to consider, though. Let's take a look at them in the context of the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.Story continuesExpense ratio: Expense ratio is the amount you'll pay as a percentage of assets to invest in a given fund. Most index funds offer very low expense ratios since there's no need to pay a fund manager to actively select individual stocks. Index funds simply respond to the market and the S&P selection committee. Both ETFs charge just 0.03% expense ratios.Turnover rate: Turnover rate is a measure of what percentage of assets a fund manager sells in a given year. A high turnover rate may indicate a poorly run index fund. Selling stock usually triggers a taxable event, but ETFs have a mechanism to avoid creating tax liabilities. Both ETFs had a turnover rate of just 2.2% in 2023.Tracking error: Tracking error measures how closely the price of the ETF reflects the value of the underlying index at any given time. A high tracking error can result in individual returns that don't match the promise of index funds -- that is, returns matching the market. If investors buy when an ETF is priced in excess of the index and sell when it's priced below the value of the index, they may end up costing themselves more than the expense ratio. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has managed a lower tracking error than the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF: 0.02% vs 0.05%. But neither result is worrisome.It might make sense to own bothYou can't go wrong with either the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF or the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. Both offer very low expense ratios and turnover rates, and the difference in their tracking errors is negligible. The overlap in their holdings ensures that you'll get very similar returns going forward. The added exposure to mid- and small-cap companies through the Total Stock Market ETF does tilt its expected returns higher although that may take a very long time to play out.If you want some added exposure to mid- and small-cap stocks, but not as much as the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF provides, you could simply buy both. Splitting your money between the two evenly will put most of your investments in large-cap stocks, but around 7% in mid- and small-cap stocks outside the S&P 500. Although you can split your funds however you want. You may need to rebalance sometimes, but since the returns of each fund are so similar, you'll never stray too far from your target allocation.At the end of the day, either or both funds can make a great cornerstone to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF right now?Before you buy stock in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF wasn’t one of them.
